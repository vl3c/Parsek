  - `BudgetSummary` and `UIMode` nested types extracted to top-level
  - Dead code removed: `GetFairingShowMesh`, `GenerateFairingTrussMesh` (zero call sites)
  - `SanitizeQuaternion` unnecessary instance wrapper removed
- **T25 — Ghost Playback Engine extraction** (ParsekFlight 9900 → 8657 lines)
  - `GhostPlaybackEngine` (1553 lines) — extracted ghost lifecycle, per-frame rendering, loop/overlap playback, zone transitions, soft caps, reentry FX from ParsekFlight. Zero Recording references; accesses trajectories via `IPlaybackTrajectory` interface only. Fires lifecycle events (OnGhostCreated, OnPlaybackCompleted, OnLoopRestarted, etc.) for policy layer.
  - `ParsekPlaybackPolicy` (192 lines) — event subscriber handling spawn decisions, resource deltas, camera management, deferred spawn queue.
  - `IPlaybackTrajectory` interface — 19-property boundary exposing only trajectory/visual data from Recording. Enables future standalone ghost playback mod.
  - `IGhostPositioner` interface — 8 positioning methods implemented by ParsekFlight, delegates world-space placement to the host scene.
  - `GhostPlaybackEvents` — TrajectoryPlaybackFlags, FrameContext, lifecycle event types, CameraActionEvent for watch-mode decomposition.
  - 109 new tests (MockTrajectory, engine lifecycle, query API, interface isolation, log assertions)
- **Pass 4 — Continued dedup**
  - `SampleAnimationStates` unified core extracted from 4 near-identical methods (D15/T27, -139 lines)
  - `AnimLookup` enum + `FindAnimation` resolver parameterize 3 animation lookup strategies
  - 4 animation sample caches consolidated into 1 `animationSampleCache`
  - `CommitBoundaryAndRestart` shared tail extracted from atmosphere/SOI split handlers (D7)
- **Pass 5 — Game action system modularization** (ParsekScenario reduced by ~1020 lines)
  - `GroupHierarchyStore` extracted — UI group hierarchy + visibility (~200 lines, zero coupling to crew/resources)
  - `ResourceApplicator` extracted — resource ticking (TickStandalone, TickTrees), budget deduction, rewind baseline correction. Coroutine shells stay on ParsekScenario.
  - `CrewReservationManager` extracted — crew reservation lifecycle (Reserve/Unreserve/Swap/Clear), replacement hiring, EVA vessel cleanup. ~40 call sites updated across 7 source files.
  - `ResourceDelta` struct + `ComputeStandaloneDelta` added to ResourceBudget — pure testable delta computation
  - `SuppressActionReplay` + `SuppressBlockingPatches` merged into single `IsReplayingActions` flag
  - `ActionReplay.ParseDetailField` removed, callers use `GameStateEventDisplay.ExtractDetailField`
  - Guard logs added to all silent early-return paths in ResourceApplicator and CrewReservationManager
- **Pass 6 — GhostPlaybackEngine decomposition** (D5, D8)
  - `ApplyFrameVisuals` extracted — deduplicates part events + flag events + reentry FX + RCS toggle from 4 call sites. `skipPartEvents` parameter preserves Site 1 semantics.
  - `RenderInRangeGhost` (~84 lines) + `HandlePastEndGhost` (~47 lines) extracted from `UpdatePlayback` loop body. Loop body reduced from ~207 to ~70 lines.
- **Pass 7 — ChainSegmentManager extraction** (T26, ParsekFlight 8657 → 8098 lines)
  - `ChainSegmentManager` (686 lines) — owns 16 chain state fields + 16 methods. ~150 field accesses migrated from ParsekFlight. `ClearAll()` replaces 13-line scattered reset.
  - Phase 1: State isolation (16 fields moved, `StopContinuation`/`StopUndockContinuation` moved)
  - Phase 2: 12 methods moved (Group A: 8 continuation methods. Group B: 4 commit methods refactored with recorder-as-parameter + bool return for abort handling)
  - `CommitSegmentCore` shared pattern (T28/D2) — stash/tag/commit/advance extracted with `Action<Recording>` callback for per-method customization. All 4 commit methods delegate to core (nullable CaptureAtStop handled for boundary splits).
  - `ClearChainIdentity()` — replaces inline 4-field reset patterns in 3 locations
  - 3 orchestration methods stay on ParsekFlight (HandleDockUndockCommitRestart, HandleChainBoardingTransition, CommitBoundaryAndRestart — own StartRecording lifecycle)
- **Pass 8 — UI dedup** (T30/D18, D19)
  - `HandleResizeDrag` + `DrawResizeHandle` static helpers — 4 drag blocks + 4 handle blocks replaced with 8 one-liner calls
  - `DrawSortableHeaderCore<TCol>` generic method — unifies `DrawSortableHeader` and `DrawSpawnSortableHeader` via `ref` sort state + `Action onChanged`. `ToggleSpawnSort` removed.
- **Pass 9 — Encapsulation** (T33)
  - `GroupHierarchyStore` accessor migration — 5 new accessor methods (`AddHiddenGroup`, `RemoveHiddenGroup`, `IsGroupHidden`, `TryGetGroupParent`, `HasGroupParent`). All ~20 ParsekUI.cs direct field accesses migrated to accessors/read-only properties.
- **Performance**
  - Per-frame `List<PartEvent>` allocations eliminated — 4 transition-check methods now append to reusable buffer (T19)
  - `TimelineGhosts` dictionary cached per-frame instead of allocating on every property access (T20)
  - `ResourceBudget.ComputeTotal` cached per-frame, shared across `DrawResourceBudget` and `DrawCompactBudgetLine` (T21)
  - Chain ghost `cachedIdx` persisted on `GhostChain` — O(n) → O(1) amortized trajectory lookup (T9)
  - `RealVesselExists` HashSet cache — O(n) linear scan → O(1) per frame with manual invalidation (T10)
- **Ghost Soft Caps** (T5)
  - `ReduceFidelity` implemented — disables 75% of renderers by index for coarse LOD silhouette
  - `SimplifyToOrbitLine` improved — hides ghost mesh with `simplified` flag, frame-skip to avoid re-processing
  - Caps-resolved branch restores fidelity and re-shows simplified ghosts
- **Audits**
  - C2: namespace consistency verified — all 73 files correct (`Parsek` or `Parsek.Patches`)
  - C3: one-class-per-file verified — 5 files have multiple types but all are acceptable data-type bundles or tightly coupled enum+class pairs
  - C4: inventory doc line counts updated to final values

### Bug Fixes

- **KSC ghost heat initialization** — KSC scene ghosts now properly start heat-animated parts in cold state. Previously, the KSC private copy of `PopulateGhostInfoDictionaries` missed the cold-state initialization that the flight scene had. Fixed by deleting the private copy and calling the shared `GhostPlaybackLogic` version.
- **Group Popup drag event leak** — Group popup window resize drag was missing `Event.current.Use()` on MouseDrag, allowing drag events to fall through to underlying windows. Fixed by extracting shared `HandleResizeDrag` helper that applies `Use()` uniformly across all 4 windows (T30/D18).
- **RestoreGhostFidelity renderer over-enable** — `RestoreGhostFidelity` previously re-enabled all renderers unconditionally, overriding part-event visibility state (decoupled/destroyed parts could reappear for one frame after soft cap resolution). Now tracks which renderers were disabled by `ReduceGhostFidelity` and only re-enables those.
- **CommitSegmentCore log index off-by-one** — Post-commit log message showed the *next* segment's index instead of the committed segment's index. Now captures index before increment.
- **ParsekUI build error** — Missing `using System` for `Action` type in `DrawSortableHeaderCore<TCol>` generic method.

### Test Suite Audit (T32)

Deep audit of all 110 test files (~55k lines). 43 files changed, +170/-1182 lines:
- 8 exact duplicate test pairs deleted
- 28 always-passing/tautological tests removed (zero-assertion, property setter, inline-math-only)
- 12 tests not exercising production code deleted (hand-written logic, ConfigNode API tests, ParsekLog direct calls)
- 17 test classes given `IDisposable` for proper shared state cleanup
- 4 misleading test names fixed
- 3 unused `logLines` captures removed, dead code cleaned up, `[Collection("Sequential")]` added to WaypointSearchTests
- 3 `.NET framework behavior` tests deleted (HashSet operations in AnchorLifecycleTests)

## 0.5.1

Spawn safety hardening, ghost visual improvements, booster/debris tree recording, flag planting, Fast Forward redesign, Real Spawn Control window. 20 PRs merged, 26 bugs fixed.

### Bug Fixes (Late)

- **Localization key mismatch on rewind** — stock vessels using `#autoLOC` keys (e.g., Aeris 4A stored as `#autoLOC_501176`) survived rewind vessel strip because name comparisons failed. Now resolves localization keys via `ResolveLocalizedName()` at all 4 strip/cleanup sites and all recording-creation sites (#126)
- **Collision check at wrong position** — `SpawnOrRecoverIfTooClose` checked the trajectory endpoint for collisions but `RespawnVessel` spawned at the snapshot position, allowing vessels to materialize on top of existing vessels. Now reads lat/lon/alt from the vessel snapshot for the collision check, with trajectory fallback. Also fixed in chain-tip spawn path (#127)

### Spawn Safety & Reliability

- **Bounding box collision detection** — replaced proximity-offset heuristic with oriented bounding box overlap checks against all loaded vessels (active vessel, debris, EVA, flags excluded)
- **Spawn collision retry limit** — 150-frame (~2.5s) collision block limit for non-chain spawns; walkback exhaustion flag for chain-tip spawns; spawn abandoned with WARN after limit hit (#110)
- **Spawn-die-respawn prevention** — 3-cycle death counter with permanent abandon for vessels destroyed immediately after spawn (e.g., FLYING at sea level killed by on-rails aero) (#110b)
- **Spawn abandon flag** — `SpawnAbandoned` prevents vessel-gone reset cycle from re-triggering spawn indefinitely
- **Non-leaf spawn suppression** — non-leaf tree recordings and FLYING/SUB_ORBITAL snapshot situations blocked from spawning; crew stripped from Destroyed-terminal-state spawn snapshots (#114)
- **SubOrbital terminal spawn suppression** — recordings with SubOrbital terminal state no longer attempt vessel spawn (#45)
- **Debris spawn suppression** — debris recordings (`IsDebris=true`) blocked from spawning real vessels
- **Orphaned vessel cleanup** — spawned vessels stripped from FLIGHTSTATE on revert and rewind; guards preserve already-set cleanup data on second rewind (#109)
- **ForceSpawnNewVessel on tree merge** — tree recordings correctly set ForceSpawnNewVessel during merge dialog callback, preventing PID dedup from skipping spawn after revert (#120)
- **ForceSpawnNewVessel on flight entry** — all same-PID committed recordings marked at flight entry for standalone recordings
- **Terminal state protection** — recovered/destroyed terminal state no longer corrupts committed recordings (#94)
- **Save stale data leak** — `initialLoadDone` reset on main menu transition prevents old recordings leaking into new saves with the same name (#98)

### Recording Improvements

- **Booster/debris tree recording** — `PromoteToTreeForBreakup` auto-promotes standalone recordings to trees on staging; creates root, continuation, and debris child recordings with 60s debris TTL. Continuation seeded with post-breakup points from root recording (#106 watch camera fix)
- **Controlled child recording** — `ProcessBreakupEvent` now creates child recordings for controlled children (vessels with probe cores surviving breakup), not just debris. Added to BackgroundRecorder with no TTL. Fixes RELATIVE anchor availability during playback (#61)
- **Flag planting recording/playback** — flag planting captured via `afterFlagPlanted`, stored as `FlagEvent` with position/rotation/flagUrl. Ghost flags built from stock flagPole prefab. Flags spawn as real vessels at playback end with world-space distance dedup
- **Auto-record from LANDED** — recording now triggers from LANDED state (not just PRELAUNCH) with 5-second settle timer to filter physics bounces, enabling save-loaded pad vessels and Mun takeoffs
- **Settle timer seed on vessel switch** — `lastLandedUT` seeded in `OnVesselSwitchComplete` for already-landed vessels, fixing auto-record for spawned vessels (#111)
- **Terminal engine/RCS events** — synthetic EngineShutdown, RCSStopped, and RoboticMotionStopped events emitted at recording stop for all active entries, preventing ghost plumes from persisting past recording end (#108)
- **Localization resolution** — `#autoLOC` keys resolved to human-readable names in vessel names and group headers via `Localizer.Format()` (#103)
- **Group name dedup** — multiple launches of same craft get unique group names: "Flea (2)", "Flea (3)" etc. (#104)
- **Chain boundary fix** — boundary splits skip standalone chain commits during tree mode, preventing nested groups in UI (#87)

### Ghost Visual Improvements

- **Compound part visuals** — fuel lines and struts render correctly on ghosts via PARTDATA/CModuleLinkedMesh fixup
- **Plume bubble fix** — ghost plume bubble artifacts eliminated by using KSP-native `KSPParticleEmitter.emit` via reflection instead of Unity emission module (#105)
- **Smoke trail fix** — Unity emission only disabled on FX objects that have KSPParticleEmitter; objects without it (smoke trails) keep their emission intact
- **Engine plume persistence** — `ModelMultiParticlePersistFX`/`ModelParticleFX` kept alive on ghosts for native KSP plume visuals (stripping them killed smoke trails)
- **Fairing cap** — `GenerateFairingConeMesh` generates flat disc cap when top XSECTION has non-zero radius (#85)
- **Fairing internal structure** — prefab Cap/Truss meshes permanently hidden; internal structure revealed only on `FairingJettisoned` event (#91)
- **Heat material fallback** — fallback path only clones materials that are tracked in `materialStates`, preventing red tint on non-heat parts (#86)
- **Surface ghost slide fix** — orbit segments skipped for LANDED/SPLASHED/PRELAUNCH vessels; `IsSurfaceAtUT` suppresses orbit interpolation for surface TrackSections; SMA < 90% body radius rejected (#93)
- **Terrain clamp** — ghost positions clamped above terrain in LateUpdate, preventing underground ghosts regardless of interpolation source
- **RELATIVE anchor fallback** — ghosts freeze at last known position instead of hiding when RELATIVE section anchor vessel is missing
- **Part events in Visual zone** — structural part events (fairing jettison, staging, destruction) now applied in the Visual zone (2.3-120km), not just Physics zone

### UI Improvements

- **Real Spawn Control window** — proximity-based UI showing ghosts within 500m whose recording ends in the future. Per-craft Warp button, sortable columns (Craft, Dist, Spawns at, In T-), and "Warp to Next Spawn" quick-jump button
- **Countdown column** — `T-Xd Xh Xm Xs` countdown in Recordings Manager, updates live during playback
- **Screen notification** when ghost craft enters spawn proximity range (10-second duration)
- **Toggle button** — "Real Spawn Control (N)" in main window, grayed out when no candidates nearby
- **Fast Forward redesign** — FF button performs instant UT jump forward (like time warp) instead of loading a quicksave; uses reflection for `BaseConverter.lastUpdateTime` to prevent burst resource production
- **Pinned bottom buttons** — Warp, Close, and action buttons pinned to window bottom in Actions, Recordings, and Spawn Control windows
- **Recordings window widened** — 1106 collapsed, 1324 expanded for better readability
- **Spawn abandon status** — spawn warnings show "walkback exhausted" / "spawn abandoned" status instead of silently retrying
- **Watch exit key** — changed from Backspace (conflicts with KSP Abort action group) to `[` or `]` bracket keys (#124)
- **Watch button guards** — disabled for out-of-range ghosts (tooltip: "Ghost is beyond visual range") and past recordings (#89, #90)
- **Watch overlay repositioned** — moved to left half of screen to avoid altimeter overlap

### Performance & Logging

- **CanRewind/CanFastForward log spam removed** — per-frame VERBOSE logs eliminated (was 578K lines/session, 94% of all output) (#117)
- **Main menu hook warning downgraded** — "Failed to register main menu hook" from WARN to VERBOSE (#118)
- **Spawn collision log demotion** — per-frame overlap log from Info to VerboseRateLimited (was ~24K lines/session)
- **GC allocation reduction** — per-frame allocations reduced in spawn UI via cached vessel names and eliminated redundant scans
- **Ghost FX audit** — systematic review of KSP-native component usage on ghosts; `KSPParticleEmitter` kept alive with `emit` control, `SmokeTrailControl` stripped (sets alpha to 0 on ghosts), `FXPrefab` stripped (pollutes FloatingOrigin), engine heat/RCS glow reimplementations retained (#113)
- **ParsekLog thread safety** — test overrides made thread-static to prevent cross-test pollution (#47)

### Bug Fixes

- **#45**: SubOrbital terminal state recordings no longer attempt vessel spawn
- **#47**: ParsekLog test overrides made thread-static
- **#85**: Fairing nosecone cap added to generated cone mesh
- **#86**: Heat material fallback only clones tracked materials, preventing red tint
- **#87**: Chain boundary commits no longer create nested groups in tree mode
- **#89**: Watch button disabled for ghosts beyond visual range
- **#90**: Watch button disabled for past (finished) recordings

- **#92**: Zone rendering tests updated for Visual-zone part events
- **#93**: Surface ghost slide fixed via orbit segment skip and SMA sanity check
- **#94**: Recovered/destroyed terminal state no longer corrupts committed recordings
- **#98**: Save data leak on same-name save recreation fixed via main menu reset
- **#103**: Localization keys resolved in vessel names and group headers

- **#106**: Watch camera booster fix via continuation point seeding
- **#108**: Synthetic shutdown events emitted at recording stop for all active engines/RCS
- **#109**: Spawned vessel cleanup preserved on second rewind
- **#110**: Spawn collision retry limited to 150 frames with abandon
- **#110b**: Spawn-die-respawn infinite loop stopped after 3 death cycles
- **#111**: Auto-record settle timer seeded on vessel switch
- **#114**: Non-leaf and FLYING/SUB_ORBITAL recordings blocked from spawning; crew stripped from destroyed-vessel snapshots
- **#119**: Watched ghosts exempt from zone distance hiding
- **#120**: Tree recordings set ForceSpawnNewVessel on merge
- **#61**: Controlled children now recorded after breakup (was "deferred to Phase 2")
- **#124**: Watch exit key changed from Backspace to brackets (Abort action group conflict)

---

## 0.5.0

Recording system redesign: multi-vessel sessions, ghost chain paradox prevention, spawn safety, time jump, and rendering zones. Recording format v5 → v7 (backward compatible).

### Recording System Redesign

- **Segment boundary rule** — only physical structural separation creates new segments. Controller changes, part destruction without splitting, and crew transfers are recorded as SegmentEvents within a continuing segment.
- **Crash coalescing** — rapid split events grouped into single BREAKUP BranchPoints via 0.5s window.
- **Environment taxonomy** — 5-state classification (Atmospheric, ExoPropulsive, ExoBallistic, SurfaceMobile, SurfaceStationary) with hysteresis (1s thrust, 3s surface speed, 0.5s surface/atmospheric bounce).
- **TrackSections** — typed trajectory chunks tagged with environment, reference frame, and data source.
- **Reference frames** — ABSOLUTE for physics, ORBITAL_CHECKPOINT for on-rails, RELATIVE for anchor-vessel proximity.

### Multi-Vessel Sessions

- **Background vessel recording** — all vessels in the physics bubble sampled at proximity-based rates (<200m: 5Hz, 200m-1km: 2Hz, 1-2.3km: 0.5Hz) with full part event capture.
- **Background vessel split detection** — creates tree BranchPoints + child recordings for all new vessels from separations. Debris children get 30s TTL.
- **Debris split detection** — `onPartDeCoupleNewVesselComplete` catches booster/debris vessels synchronously at decouple time. Debris trajectory recording planned for v0.5.1.
- **Highest-fidelity-wins merge** — overlapping Active/Background/Checkpoint TrackSections merged per vessel with snap-switch at boundaries.
- **Per-vessel merge dialog** — extended dialog shows per-vessel persist/ghost-only decisions.

### Relative Frames & Anchoring

- **Anchor detection** — nearest in-flight vessel with 2300m entry / 2500m exit hysteresis. Landed/splashed vessels excluded (not loaded during playback far from surface).
- **Relative recording** — offsets stored as dx/dy/dz from anchor vessel for pixel-perfect docking playback.
- **Relative playback** — ghost positioned at anchor's current world position + stored offset, FloatingOrigin-safe.
- **Loop phase tracking** — preserves phase across anchor vessel load/unload via pure arithmetic.

### Ghost Chain Paradox Prevention

- **Ghost chain model** — committed recordings that interact with pre-existing vessels (docking, undocking, etc.) cause those vessels to become ghosts from rewind until the chain tip resolves.
- **Chain walker algorithm** — scans all committed trees for vessel-claiming events, builds ordered chains, resolves cross-tree links.
- **Intermediate spawn suppression** — multi-link chains (bare-S → S+A → S+A+B) only spawn at the tip.
- **Ghost conversion** — real vessels despawned and replaced with ghost GameObjects during chain windows.
- **PID preservation** — chain-tip spawns preserve the original vessel's persistentId for cross-tree chain linking.
- **Ghosting trigger taxonomy** — structural events, orbital changes, and part state changes trigger ghosting; cosmetic events (lights) do not.

### Spawn Safety

- **Bounding box collision detection** — spawn blocked when overlapping with loaded vessels (active vessel, debris, EVA, flags excluded).
- **Ghost extension** — ghost continues on propagated orbit/surface past recording end while spawn is blocked.
- **Trajectory walkback** — for immovable blockers, walks backward along recorded trajectory to find a valid spawn position.
- **Terrain correction** — surface spawns adjusted for terrain height changes between recording and playback.

### Time Jump

- **Relative-state time jump** — discrete UT skip that advances the game clock while keeping the physics bubble frozen in place, preserving rendezvous geometry across ghost chain windows.
- **Epoch-shifted orbits** — orbital elements recomputed at the new UT from captured state vectors for Keplerian consistency.
- **TIME_JUMP SegmentEvent** — records the discontinuity for playback handling.

### Ghost World Presence

- **CommNet relay** — ghost vessels register as CommNet nodes with antenna specs from ModuleDataTransmitter, maintaining communication network coverage during ghost windows.
- **Ghost labels** — floating text labels showing vessel name, ghost status, and chain tip UT.
- **Map view / tracking station** — infrastructure stubs for ghost orbit lines and nav targets (full KSP integration pending).

### Rendering & Performance

- **Distance-based zones** — Physics (<2.3km, full fidelity), Visual (2.3-120km, mesh only), Beyond (120km+, no mesh).
- **Zone-aware playback** — per-ghost distance computation, zone transition detection, part events gated to Physics zone.
- **Ghost soft caps** — configurable thresholds with priority-based despawning (LoopedOldest first, FullTimeline kept longest). Disabled by default until profiled.
- **Settings UI** — three slider controls for cap thresholds with enable toggle and live apply.
- **Log spam mitigation** — rate-limited high-volume diagnostics (SoftCap, zone, heat, engine FX).

### Bug Fixes (70 tracked, 48 fixed)

- **#51**: Chain ID lost on vessel-switch auto-stop — proper segment commit and chain termination
- **#52**: CanRewind log spam (485K lines) — verbose removed from success path
- **#53**: Re-show log spam (16K lines) — deduplicated via loggedReshow HashSet
- **#54**: Watch mode beyond terrain range — 2s grace period then auto-exit
- **#55**: RELATIVE anchor on debris — vessel type filtering + surface skip
- **#9**: Zero-frame TrackSections from brief RELATIVE flickers — discarded
- Active TrackSections not flushed to tree recordings — FlushRecorderToTreeRecording, CreateSplitBranch, CreateMergeBranch now copy TrackSections
- Watch mode camera re-targeting — deferred spawn no longer switches camera to spawned vessel after watch mode ends at recording boundary
- Rewind save propagation fixed across tree/EVA/split paths
- Soft cap spawn-despawn loop — suppression set prevents re-spawn after cap despawn
- Zone hide vs warp re-show loop — check currentZone before re-showing
- False RELATIVE anchor at launchpad — skip anchor detection on surface
- Watch mode on beyond-range looped ghost — loop phase offset reset
- Background split children capture vessel snapshots for ghost playback
- See `docs/dev/todo-and-known-bugs.md` for full list

### Format Changes

- Recording format v5 → v7 (additive, backward compatible)
- v6: SegmentEvents, TrackSections, ControllerInfo, extended BranchPoint types (Launch, Breakup, Terminal)
- v7: TerrainHeightAtEnd for surface spawn terrain correction
