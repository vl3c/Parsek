## 0.5.3

### Bug Fixes

- **Fix #168: Spawned vessels not re-spawned after rewind/revert.** After vessel stripping on revert, `SpawnedVesselPersistentId` was restored from the save but pointed to a stripped vessel — blocking re-spawn permanently. Added `ReconcileSpawnStateAfterStrip` that checks surviving PIDs in flightState after all strip operations and resets spawn tracking for recordings whose vessel no longer exists.

## 0.5.3

### Features

- **T97: Altitude-based chain splits for airless bodies.** Recordings auto-split when crossing the approach altitude threshold on bodies without atmosphere (Mun, Minmus, Tylo, etc.). Uses KSP's native `timeWarpAltitudeLimits[4]` (100x warp limit) as the threshold, with `body.Radius * 0.15` as fallback. Enables selective looping of landing approaches without looping orbital coasts.
- **T97: "approach" phase tagging.** Airless body segments below the threshold are tagged `"approach"` (sky blue in UI) instead of `"space"`. All phase tagging sites updated.
- **T97: TrackSection altitude metadata.** Min/max altitude tracked per TrackSection during recording. Serialized as sparse keys, backward compatible with existing saves.
- **T97: Recording optimization pass.** Automatic housekeeping merges redundant consecutive chain segments on save load (same phase, same body, no branch points, no ghosting triggers, no user-modified settings).
- **T98: Per-phase looping for all recording modes.** Tree recordings are now split into per-phase segments after commit, matching chain mode's per-phase loop toggles. The optimizer's split pass (`FindSplitCandidatesForOptimizer`) breaks multi-environment recordings at environment boundaries without the conservative ghosting-trigger check. Each phase gets its own loop toggle in the UI. Auto loop range trims boring bookends (orbital coasts, surface idle) when loop is toggled on.
- **T98: Loop range fields.** New `LoopStartUT`/`LoopEndUT` fields on Recording narrow the loop range. Engine (`TryComputeLoopPlaybackUT`, `ShouldLoopPlayback`), save/load (both paths), and `CanAutoMerge` updated. Backward compatible (NaN defaults = existing behavior).
- **T98: Policy modularity refactor.** Migrated scattered `TreeId != null` / `ChainId != null` policy checks to `IsTreeRecording` / `IsChainRecording` / `ManagesOwnResources` query properties. Extracted `ClassifyVesselDestruction` and `ShouldSuppressBoundarySplit` as testable static methods.

### Ghost Map Presence (bug #60)

Ghost vessels now appear in KSP's tracking station, show orbit lines in map view, and can be targeted for rendezvous planning. Works for both ghost chain vessels and timeline playback ghosts.

- **ProtoVessel-based map integration** — lightweight ProtoVessel (single `sensorBarometer` part) per ghost provides automatic tracking station entry, orbit line (OrbitRenderer), clickable map icon (MapObject), and navigation targeting (ITargetable). Created on chain init or engine ghost spawn, removed on resolve/destroy/rewind/scene cleanup, stripped from saves.
- **Timeline playback + chain ghosts** — both recording-index ghosts (from the playback engine) and chain ghosts (from `VesselGhoster`) get ProtoVessels. Parallel tracking dicts with unified cleanup via `RemoveAllGhostPresenceForIndex`.
- **Deferred orbit line creation** — recordings that start pre-orbital (launch-to-orbit) don't show orbit lines during atmospheric ascent. ProtoVessel created when ghost enters first orbital segment, with the current segment's orbit (not terminal orbit).
- **Per-frame orbit segment tracking** — ghost ProtoVessel orbit updates as the ghost traverses segments (Hohmann transfers, SOI transitions). Both chain and recording-index ghosts use `ApplyOrbitToVessel` with direct element assignment via `Orbit.SetOrbit()`.
- **Terminal state filtering** — only Orbiting/Docked recordings get orbit lines. Destroyed, SubOrbital, Landed, Splashed skip (misleading orbit). Debris always skipped.
- **30 guard rails** across 10 source files — `IsGhostMapVessel(pid)` checks on all `FlightGlobals.Vessels` iteration sites and vessel GameEvent handlers.
- **6 Harmony patches** — `Vessel.GoOffRails` (prevent physics loading), `CommNetVessel.OnStart` (prevent duplicate CommNet nodes), `FlightGlobals.SetActiveVessel` (redirect to watch mode), `SpaceTracking.FlyVessel`/`OnVesselDeleteConfirm`/`OnRecoverConfirm` (block tracking station actions with screen message, release input lock via `OnDialogDismiss`).
- **Tracking station scene support** — `ParsekTrackingStation` addon creates ghost ProtoVessels from committed recordings when visiting tracking station directly.
- **Soft cap integration** — `Despawn` removes ProtoVessel; `ReduceFidelity` and `SimplifyToOrbitLine` keep it (orbit line stays visible when mesh is hidden).
- **Target transfer** — if ghost was the navigation target when chain resolves, the spawned vessel becomes the new target.
- **VesselType mirroring** — ghost uses the original vessel's type from snapshot for correct filter placement.
- **Green dot suppression** — `DrawMapMarkers` skips the old GUI overlay dot when a native KSP map icon exists for that ghost.
- **Merge dialog re-evaluation** — `MergeDialog.OnTreeCommitted` callback triggers chain re-evaluation so ghost ProtoVessels are created immediately after commit+revert.
- **46 tests** — PID tracking, HasOrbitData, ComputeGhostDisplayInfo, ResolveVesselType, terminal state filtering, debris filtering, StartsInOrbit, orbit segment tracking, log assertions.

### Group UI Enhancements

- **Group header columns in recordings window.** Groups now display Launch (earliest member StartUT), Duration (sum of member durations), and Status (closest active T- countdown) columns. Groups participate in column-based sorting alongside chains and standalone recordings instead of always rendering first. Six `internal static` helpers extracted for testability with 27 unit tests.
- **Fix #176: Group hide checkbox misaligned when expanded stats visible.** Group rows were missing spacers for the MaxAlt/MaxSpd/Dist/Pts columns, causing the trailing Hide checkbox to shift out of alignment when the Stats panel was open.

- **Per-frame orbit segment tracking** — ghost ProtoVessel orbit updates as the ghost traverses segments (Hohmann transfers, SOI transitions). Both chain and recording-index ghosts use the same `ApplyOrbitToVessel`/`BuildOrbitFromSegment` helpers.
- **Terminal state filtering** — only Orbiting/Docked recordings get orbit lines. Destroyed, SubOrbital, Landed, Splashed skip (misleading orbit). Debris always skipped.
- **30 guard rails** across 10 source files — `IsGhostMapVessel(pid)` checks on all `FlightGlobals.Vessels` iteration sites and vessel GameEvent handlers.

### Bug Fixes

- **Fix #175: EVA kerbal spawns at recording start position instead of endpoint.** EVA vessel snapshots are captured at EVA start (kerbal on the pod's ladder), but the kerbal walks elsewhere during the recording. On spawn, the snapshot's baked-in lat/lon/alt placed the kerbal on top of the parent vessel, grabbing its ladder and triggering KSP's "Kerbals on a ladder — cannot save" error. `ResolveSpawnPosition` now routes EVA recordings to the trajectory endpoint; `OverrideSnapshotPosition` patches the snapshot before `RespawnVessel`.
- **Fix #179: Orbital vessel destroyed by pressure on spawn.** Three-part fix: (1) `terminalOverridesUnsafe` includes `TerminalState.Orbiting`, allowing spawn eligibility. (2) KSC spawn defers orbital vessels to flight scene (Space Center `pv.Load()` crashes them through terrain). (3) Flight-scene spawn uses `SpawnAtPosition` for orbital vessels to construct correct Keplerian orbit from last trajectory point position+velocity — `RespawnVessel` used the raw ascent snapshot orbit whose periapsis was in atmosphere. Additionally, `SpawnAtPosition` now accepts an optional `terminalState` parameter: when the terminal state is Orbiting/Docked but `DetermineSituation` returns FLYING (last trajectory point captured during ascent at suborbital speed), the situation is overridden to ORBITING to prevent KSP's on-rails 101.3 kPa pressure check from destroying the vessel.
- **Fix #172: Ghost map icon position + orbit lines not rendering + icon click menu.** Three-part fix: (1) Replaced `Orbit.UpdateFromOrbitAtUT()` with `Orbit.SetOrbit()` in `ApplyOrbitToVessel` — the old path roundtripped through state vectors, introducing floating-point drift in `argumentOfPeriapsis` for near-circular orbits (confirmed 0.0m offset after fix). (2) Added `deferredCreatedEvents.Add()` to `UpdateLoopingPlayback` and `UpdateOverlapPlayback` in `GhostPlaybackEngine` — only `RenderInRangeGhost` was firing `OnGhostCreated`, so looping ghosts never got ProtoVessels and orbit lines never rendered. (3) Added `GhostIconClickPatch` (postfix on `objectNode_OnClick`) showing a popup near cursor with "Set As Target" / "Watch" options. Ghost orbit lines are visual-only (not clickable via `GhostOrbitCastPatch`) to avoid ambiguity with real vessels sharing the same orbit. Watch mode entry distance now reads user's `ghostCameraCutoffKm` setting instead of hardcoded 100km.
- **Fix #180: Clicking ghost vessel in tracking station traps user with input lock.** `GhostTrackingFlyPatch` blocked `FlyVessel` for ghost map vessels but didn't dismiss the dialog, leaving a stale input lock. Now calls `OnDialogDismiss` after blocking. Also fixed `GhostVesselSwitchPatch` overload targeting — replaced unreliable attribute-based `Type[]` with explicit `TargetMethod()` for `FlightGlobals.SetActiveVessel`.
- **Fix #171: Orbital ghost disappears during 50x time warp.** During warp >4x, ghosts with orbital segments are now exempt from zone-based mesh hiding (`ShouldExemptFromZoneHide` in `GhostPlaybackLogic`). Prevents orbital ghosts from completing playback while invisible in the Beyond zone.
- **Fix #172: Ghost destruction reason logged as "unknown".** `RetryHeldGhostSpawns` now passes per-action reason strings to `DestroyGhost`: `"held-spawn-succeeded"`, `"held-already-spawned"`, `"held-spawn-timeout"`, `"held-invalid-index"`.
- **Fix #173: Zero-point debris leaf recordings saved from same-frame destruction.** Added `PruneZeroPointLeaves` step in `FinalizeTreeRecordings` — removes leaf recordings with zero trajectory points, no orbit segments, and no surface position. Prevents `.prec` sidecar files and tree nodes for instantly-destroyed debris.
- **Fix #174: ChainWalker evaluates terminated chains every frame.** Two-level filtering: `IsTreeFullyTerminated` skips scanning trees where all leaves are Destroyed/Recovered; `EvaluateAndApplyGhostChains` excludes terminated chains from `activeGhostChains`.
- **Fix #158: Watch mode auto-follow picks debris instead of core vessel after separation.** `FindNextWatchTarget` now recursively descends through PID-matched continuations that have no active ghost (boundary seed recordings). If the PID-matched continuation exists but has no ghost anywhere in its subtree, debris fallback is suppressed — watch hold expires naturally instead of following a booster.
- **Fix #168: Spawned vessels not re-spawned after rewind/revert.** After vessel stripping on revert, `SpawnedVesselPersistentId` was restored from the save but pointed to a stripped vessel — blocking re-spawn permanently. Added `ReconcileSpawnStateAfterStrip` that checks surviving PIDs in flightState after all strip operations and resets spawn tracking for recordings whose vessel no longer exists.
- **Fix #170: Vessel spawned near launch pad collides with infrastructure, chain-explodes player's rocket.** Added 50m KSC exclusion zones around launch pad and runway start point (`IsWithinKscExclusionZone` in `SpawnCollisionDetector`) to block spawns near infrastructure. Fixed `RemoveDeadCrewFromSnapshot` to remove reserved crew who are Dead (reservation no longer overrides death). Added `ShouldBlockSpawnForDeadCrew` guard to abandon spawn when all crew are dead.
- **Fix #72: GhostCommNetRelay antenna combination formula wrong for non-combinable strongest.** Extracted `ResolveCombinationExponent` pure method. When the overall strongest antenna is non-combinable, the combination exponent now comes from the strongest *combinable* antenna, matching KSP's actual formula.
- **Fix #81: TrackSection struct shallow copy shares mutable list references.** Extracted `Recording.DeepCopyTrackSections` that creates independent `frames` and `checkpoints` lists for each copied TrackSection. Used in `ApplyPersistenceArtifactsFrom`.
- **Fix #122: Dead->Dead crew status identity transitions logged as events.** Added `IsRealStatusChange` guard in `GameStateRecorder.OnKerbalStatusChange` to filter identity transitions before recording.
- **Fix #123: #autoLOC localization keys in internal log messages.** Wrapped `v.vesselName` in `TimeJumpManager` and `other.vesselName` in `SpawnCollisionDetector` with `Recording.ResolveLocalizedName()`.
- **Fix #131: Explosion GO count can reach ~90 for overlapping reentry loops.** Added `MaxActiveExplosions = 30` cap in `TriggerExplosionIfDestroyed`. New explosions are skipped (with logging) when at cap; ghost parts are still hidden.

- **Fix #78: DetermineTerminalState maps DOCKED to Orbiting.** Changed `case 128` (DOCKED) to return `TerminalState.Docked` instead of `TerminalState.Orbiting`. Edge case for debris that docks.
- **Fix #80: TimeJumpManager.ExecuteJump no warp guard.** Added warp stop at the start of `ExecuteJump` — calls `TimeWarp.SetRate(0, true)` when `CurrentRateIndex > 0` to prevent desync from `SetUniversalTime` during warp.
- **Fix #75: GhostPlaybackLogic inconsistent negative interval handling.** Added early guard in `ComputeLoopPhaseFromUT` for `currentUT < recordingStartUT`, consistent with `TryComputeLoopPlaybackUT`. Removed redundant duplicate guard.
- **Fix #82: IsDebris, Controllers, SurfacePos not serialized for standalone recordings.** Added save/load for all three fields in `ParsekScenario.SaveStandaloneRecordings` / `LoadStandaloneRecordingsFromNodes`, matching the tree recording pattern.

- **Fix #134: CleanupOrphanedSpawnedVessels destroys freshly-spawned past vessels after rewind.** The rewind path populated `PendingCleanupNames` with all recording vessel names for `StripOrphanedSpawnedVessels`, but left them set for `CleanupOrphanedSpawnedVessels` in `OnFlightReady`, which then destroyed correctly-spawned past vessels. Fix: clear `PendingCleanupPids`/`PendingCleanupNames` immediately after the strip completes.
- **Fix #43: Update known-bugs status.** Shader fallback lookup (`FindShaderOnRenderers`) was already implemented in commit 25ccfa9 but doc status was stale.
- **Fix #95: Preserve VesselSnapshot on committed recordings.** Removed snapshot nulling from continuation vessel destroyed and EVA boarding handlers. `VesselDestroyed` flag gates spawn and is now reset by `ResetRecordingPlaybackFields` on revert/rewind. `UpdateRecordingsForTerminalEvent` skips all committed recordings. Items 3-5 (continuation sampling/refresh) deferred as tech debt.
- **Fix #96: Hold ghost until spawn succeeds.** Ghost no longer disappears when spawn is blocked or warp-deferred. `HandlePlaybackCompleted` holds the ghost at its final position via `heldGhosts` dict. `RetryHeldGhostSpawns` retries each frame, releasing on success or 5s timeout.
- **Fix #99: Spawn real vessels at KSC when ghost timelines complete.** `ParsekKSC.TrySpawnAtRecordingEnd` calls `VesselSpawner.RespawnVessel` when ghosts exit range. Chain mid-segment suppression via `IsChainMidSegment`. `OnSave` auto-unreserve guarded at SpaceCenter to prevent snapshot pre-emption.

- **Fix #48: Use actual body radius in ComputeBoundaryDiscontinuity.** Replaced hardcoded Kerbin radius (600,000m) with lookup from static dictionary of 17 stock KSP body radii. Diagnostic-only fix — logged discontinuity magnitude is now accurate on all bodies.
- **Fix #77: Use InvariantCulture for TerrainCorrector log formatting.** Replaced 8 `{val:F1}` interpolation sites with `.ToString("F1", IC)` to prevent comma-decimal output on non-English locales.
- **Fix #73: Filter vessel types in CheckWarningProximity.** Extracted `ShouldSkipVesselType` helper (Debris/EVA/Flag/SpaceObject) shared between `CheckOverlapAgainstLoadedVessels` and `CheckWarningProximity`.
- **Fix #129: Strip future PRELAUNCH vessels on rewind.** Unrecorded pad vessels from the future persisted after rewind because `StripOrphanedSpawnedVessels` only matched recorded names. Added PID-based quicksave whitelist: `PreProcessRewindSave` captures surviving vessel PIDs, `HandleRewindOnLoad` strips any PRELAUNCH vessel not in the whitelist.
- **Fix #137: Rescue reserved crew from Missing after EVA vessel removal.** `vessel.Unload()` in `RemoveReservedEvaVessels` orphaned crew → KSP set them Missing. Added `RescueReservedCrewAfterEvaRemoval` to restore Missing→Assigned for crew in `crewReplacements` dict.
- **Fix #64: Clear pending tree/recording on revert.** Merge dialog shown twice when reverting during tree destruction. `pendingTree` (static) persisted across scene transitions without cleanup. Now discarded in the OnLoad revert path.
- **Fix #71: Remove old CommNode before re-registration.** `RegisterNode` now removes existing node from CommNet before adding new one, preventing orphaned nodes.
- **Fix #79: SpawnCrossedChainTips no longer mutates caller's dict.** Returns spawned PIDs list; caller removes after call.
- **Fix #84: int→long for cycleIndex.** Prevents integer overflow in loop phase calculations for very long sessions. Updated across 10 files (state, events, logic, engine, KSC, flight).
- **Fix #101: BackgroundRecorder.SubscribePartEvents now called.** Part events (onPartDie, onPartJointBreak) are now subscribed for background vessels at both tree creation sites.
- **Fix #102: CreateSplitBranch copies FlagEvents and SegmentEvents.** Previously omitted, causing flag/segment data loss on tree split.
- **Fix #130: Cache vesselName on GhostPlaybackState.** Destroy events now show vessel name even when trajectory reference is null (loop restart).

- **Fix #139: Merge dialog not shown on revert to launch.** Bug #64 fix unconditionally discarded freshly-stashed pendings. Added `PendingStashedThisTransition` flag to distinguish fresh (keep) vs stale (discard) pendings across scene transitions.
- **Fix #140: Camera resets to active vessel on loop ghost cycle boundary.** Non-destroyed looped ghosts left FlightCamera with null target between destroy/respawn. `ExplosionHoldEnd` now creates a temporary camera bridge anchor; `RetargetToNewGhost` cleans it up.
- **Fix #141: Budget deduction drives science/funds/reputation negative.** Extracted `ClampDeduction(reserved, available)` pure method. All three resource types clamped to available balance.
- **Fix #142: Ghosts spawning into dying scene after DestroyAllGhosts.** Added `sceneChangeInProgress` flag to suppress `Update()`/`LateUpdate()` after `OnSceneChangeRequested`.
- **Fix #143: ApplyTreeResourceDeltas per-frame no-op overhead.** Added fast-path early-out when all trees already have `ResourcesApplied=true`.
- **Fix #144: Degraded trees (0 points) deduct budget.** Extracted `RecordingTree.IsDegraded`/`ComputeEndUT()`. Trees with no trajectory data skip budget application.
- **Fix #145: Ghoster WARN spam for non-existent synthetic vessels.** Pre-check vessel existence before ghosting; downgraded to VERBOSE.
- **Fix #22 (revised): Facility upgrade replay deferred instead of dropped.** Facility upgrades in Flight scene now set `deferred=true`, stopping the watermark so they are retried on next scene load (previously marked as replayed and permanently skipped).
- **Fix #146: Ghost frozen at final position after watch hold.** `watchEndHoldUntilUT` was set but never consumed — ghost held indefinitely. Added expiry check in `UpdateWatchCamera` that retries auto-follow during hold, then destroys ghost on timeout.
- **Fix #147: Watch mode auto-follow race condition.** Continuation ghost not yet spawned when `FindNextWatchTarget` runs at completion. Hold timer now retries every frame; auto-follows as soon as continuation appears.
- **Fix #148: Fast-forward doesn't transfer watch to target.** `FastForwardToRecording` now exits watch and defers entering on the FF target after engine positions ghosts.
- **Fix #149: RCS throttle event spam.** Deadband increased from 1% to 5% — reduces RCS part events by ~90% for SAS-active flights.

- **Fix #135: ParsePartPositions wrong key.** `SpawnCollisionDetector.ParsePartPositions` only checked `"pos"` but KSP vessel snapshots use `"position"`. Parsed 0/40 parts on real vessels, falling back to inaccurate 2m bounds. Now checks both keys.
- **Fix #150: Engine/RCS FX not stopped at on-rails.** `FlightRecorder.OnVesselGoOnRails` now calls `EmitTerminalEngineAndRcsEvents()` before going on-rails. Ghost engine plumes no longer persist during orbit segments.
- **Fix #151: FF watch renders broken scene.** Added 100km distance guard in `EnterWatchMode` — refuses watch when ghost is beyond rendering-safe distance from active vessel. Rate-limited `FindNextWatchTarget` logging during watch hold.
- **Fix: Enter key on camera cutoff input.** Enter key now commits the value (KeyDown was consumed by TextField before the check ran).
- **Fix #74: RELATIVE mode boundary point at on-rails.** `SamplePosition` recorded absolute lat/lon/alt into a RELATIVE TrackSection at on-rails boundaries. Moved RELATIVE clearing before boundary sampling.
- **Fix #107: Engine/SRB smoke trails vanish on ghost despawn.** Particle systems are now detached from the ghost hierarchy before destruction, allowing trails to fade naturally (8s linger).
- **Fix #125: Engine plate shrouds not visible on ghost.** Inactive-variant renderer filter preempted GAMEOBJECT rules. When explicit variant rules exist, they are now the sole authority on object inclusion.
- **Engine throttle deadband increased to 5%.** SRBs with smooth thrust curves generated excessive EngineThrottle events at 1% deadband. Matches RCS deadband (#149).
- **Fix #56: Auto-record EVA from any vessel situation.** Removed PRELAUNCH restriction — kerbals EVA'ing from landed bases, orbiting stations, etc. now auto-record.
- **Fix #57: Boarding confirmation timeout too short.** Increased from 3 frames (~60ms) to 10 frames (~200ms).
- **Fix #115/#116: Crew lost to Missing after rewind vessel strip.** New `RescueOrphanedCrew` sets orphaned Assigned crew to Available after vessel stripping, before KSP's validation marks them Missing.
- **Fix #155: Orphaned recording lost on auto-record vessel switch.** `StartRecording` now commits the orphaned recorder's data before creating a new one.
- **Fix #76: GhostExtender hyperbolic fallback negative altitude.** Added `Math.Max(0, ...)` to prevent ghost underground placement.
- **Fix #157: Green sphere ghost for ghost-only debris.** `ApplyVesselDecisions` now preserves `GhostVisualSnapshot` before nulling spawn snapshot.
- **Fix #161: EVA snapshot situation stale.** `ShouldSpawnAtRecordingEnd` overrides unsafe-situation check when terminal state is Landed/Splashed.
- **Fix #162: AutoCommitGhostOnly strips snapshot from landed EVAs.** Preserves `VesselSnapshot` for Landed/Splashed terminals.
- **Fix #163: KSC spawns vessels from the future after rewind.** `ShouldSpawnAtKscEnd` now checks `currentUT >= EndUT`.
- **Fix #165: Engine flame flash on ignition.** Seed events for engines at zero throttle (staged but idle on the pad) are now skipped entirely — no plume at playback start. The first real throttle-up event starts the plume at the correct time. Playback retains `Math.Max(0.01f)` floor for backward compatibility with older recordings.
- **Fix #169: EVA vessel spawned FLYING destroyed by on-rails pressure.** EVA snapshot captured `sit=FLYING` but terminal state was Landed. KSP's on-rails pressure check killed the vessel instantly, crew set to Dead. `CorrectUnsafeSnapshotSituation` now corrects FLYING/SUB_ORBITAL to LANDED/SPLASHED before spawning when terminal state indicates safe surface arrival.
- **Fix #164: Strip all future vessels on rewind, not just PRELAUNCH.** Flags, landed capsules, and other player-created vessels from the future now removed after rewind.
- **Fix #167: Crew swap not executed for KSC-spawned vessels.** `SwapReservedCrewInFlight` only runs in flight scene — KSC spawns via `TrySpawnAtRecordingEnd` never swapped reserved crew. Added `SwapReservedCrewInSnapshot` to replace reserved crew names directly in the snapshot ConfigNode before spawning.
- **DeferredActivateVessel timeout increased** from 10 frames to 5 seconds. Distant spawned vessels (37km+) couldn't load in 10 frames.
- **ComputeTotal logging removed.** Eliminated 52% of all Parsek log output (pure computation was logging every UI frame).
- **Status column widened** (95→120px) for longer T+ timestamps.
- **R/FF button state transition logging** for debugging enable/disable issues.

### Features

- **Settings window: "Ghosts" group.** Merged "Ghost Camera" and "Ghost Soft Caps" sections into a single "Ghosts" group. Added checkbox-to-label spacing for all settings toggles.
- **Fix #50: Chain block enable/loop checkboxes.** Chain headers now have aggregate enable and loop checkboxes (were empty spacers).
- **Fix #98: Merge Countdown into Status column.** Status now shows `T-Xm Xs` for future, `Active` for playing, terminal state name for past.
- **Fix #88: Commit approval dialog for landed/splashed vessels.** When leaving Flight to KSC or Tracking Station with a landed/splashed vessel, shows Keep/Discard dialog instead of auto-committing. Game exit still auto-commits.

- **Ghost camera cutoff setting.** Settings > Ghost Camera > Cutoff [300] km. Watch mode auto-exits when ghost exceeds this distance. Watch button disabled for ghosts beyond cutoff. Default 300km, configurable 10-10000km.
- **Watch mode distance overlay.** "Watching: Vessel (45.2 km)" in the notification bar shows distance from ghost to active vessel.
- **Watch mode auto-follow on stage separation.** Camera automatically follows the controller vessel through tree branch points and chain continuations.
- **T+ mission time in Countdown column.** Past/live recordings show elapsed time since launch (T+Xh Ym Zs) instead of "LIVE" or "-".
- **Debris subgroups in recordings window.** Debris recordings from stage separations are auto-grouped under a "Vessel / Debris" subgroup. Orphaned split segments adopted into the tree group on commit.

### Previously Fixed (Confirmed)

- **#43** (shader fallback), **#49** (RealVesselExists O(n)) — already fixed in prior releases.
- **#121** (Ghost SKIPPED log spam) — resolved by T25 Phase 9 engine extraction.
- **#133** — removed 6 dead forwarding methods + 2 unused properties from ParsekFlight, inlined call sites.
- **#63** — added `errorWhitelist` parameter to `ParsekLogContractChecker.ValidateLatestSession`.
- **#83** — CommNet stale nodes concern is not a bug; follows stock KSP re-registration pattern.
- **#108** — engine cutoff polling logic (`EngineIgnited && isOperational`) correctly catches flameout; remaining inconsistency needs in-game repro.
- **#113** — stock FX modules infeasible on ghost architecture; current reimplementation is correct.
- **#153** — AnimateHeat nose cone classification requires reflection hack for negligible visual effect; won't fix.
- **#156** — extracted `IsPadFailure` static method + 7 tests; remaining items need Unity runtime.

Log spam audit and cleanup. Analyzed a 28,923-line KSP.log from a 70-second KSC session with 273 recordings — Parsek was 68.4% of all output (19,771 lines). Identified and fixed the top spam sources.

### Log Cleanup

- **Removed `ParsekLog.Log()` method** — all 26 call sites (16 in EngineFxBuilder, 10 in GhostVisualBuilder) were using the subsystem-less `Log()` wrapper, producing 2,651 lines tagged as `[General]` (55% of all INFO output). Migrated to proper `Verbose("EngineFx")` / `Verbose("GhostVisual")` / `Info("GhostVisual")`. Deleted the method to prevent future untagged usage.
- **ReentryFx INFO→VERBOSE** — mesh combination and fire shell overlay messages fired per ghost build at INFO level (2,148 lines in 70s). Downgraded to Verbose.
- **KSC per-ghost spawn/destroy INFO→VERBOSE** — per-ghost spawn, enter-range, re-show, warp-hide, and no-longer-eligible messages at INFO level (1,347 lines). Downgraded to Verbose. Added batch summary in OnDestroy (`Destroyed N primary + N overlap KSC ghosts`).
- **FlightRecorder point logging rate-limited** — `Recorded point #N` logged every 10th physics frame at Verbose without rate limiting (~50 lines/sec during recording). Changed to `VerboseRateLimited` with 5s interval.
- **Mass ghost teardown batched** — KSC `DestroyKscGhost` per-ghost log (277 consecutive in one burst) changed to `VerboseRateLimited`. Overlap ghost destroy in `GhostPlaybackEngine` similarly rate-limited.
- **Per-renderer VERBOSE diagnostics removed** — individual MR[N]/SMR[N] per-renderer logs (1,041+ lines), per-renderer damaged-wheel skip logs, and per-SMR bone fallback logs removed. Per-part summary already captures the same counts.
- **Subsystem tag consolidation** — `Store`→`RecordingStore` (1 occurrence), `GhostBuild`→`GhostVisual` (5 occurrences). Reduces tag count from 63 to 61.

### Round 2 — Ghost Lifecycle Batch Logging

- **Frame batch summary** — replaced per-ghost spawn/destroy/build Verbose logs (15,489 Engine lines) with per-frame counters and one `VerboseRateLimited` summary: `Frame: spawned=N destroyed=N active=N`.
- **DestroyGhost reason parameter** — all 7+ call sites now pass a reason string (`"cycle transition"`, `"soft cap despawn"`, `"anchor unloaded"`, etc.). Per-ghost destroy log restored at 1s rate limit with full context.
- **SpawnGhost per-ghost log restored** — 1s rate-limited per-index key with build type (snapshot/sphere), part/engine/rcs counts.
- **ShouldTriggerExplosion skip logs removed** — 1,959 lines/session of pure predicate noise (caller already knows the result).
- **CrewReservation null snapshot log removed** — 515 lines of expected-path noise.
- **ReentryFx → shared rate-limit keys** — mesh combination messages now dedup across all ghosts (was per-ghost-index).
- **Overlap/explosion lifecycle → shared VRL keys** — overlap move, overlap expired, explosion created, parts hidden, loop restarted, overlap expired all changed from per-index to shared keys.
- **Zone rendering Info→VRL** — per-ghost zone transition messages downgraded from Info to VerboseRateLimited (1,008 lines).
- **Bug #135 cleanup** — fixed 12 garbled comments in ShouldSpawnAtRecordingEnd left from prior partial edit.

### Round 3 — Serialization Batch Summaries

- **Per-recording serialization logs removed** — 12 Verbose logs in RecordingStore (orbit segments, track sections, segment events, file summaries) and 2 per-recording metadata logs in ParsekScenario removed. These produced ~2,900 lines per save/load cycle.
- **4 batch summaries added** — standalone save/load and tree save/load now log one summary each with aggregate counters (points, orbit segments, part events, track sections, snapshots).
- **DeserializeSegmentEvents** — changed from always-log to Warn-only when events are skipped.

### Round 4 — Remaining Spam Sources

- **SpawnWarning FormatChainStatus** — Verbose → VerboseRateLimited shared key. Per-frame poll logging identical status (1,165 lines, 802-line burst).
- **Zone transition per-ghost** — Info → VerboseRateLimited shared key. 248-ghost bursts at scene switch collapsed to 1 line.
- **Scenario per-recording index dump** — Info → Verbose. Summary header stays at Info; per-recording detail demoted.
- **Per-recording "Loaded recording:"** — ScenarioLog (Info) → Verbose. Batch summary covers aggregates.
- **"Triggering explosion"** — Info → VerboseRateLimited per-index 10s. Looping overlap re-explosions deduplicated.

### Documentation

  - `SanitizeQuaternion` unnecessary instance wrapper removed
- **T25 — Ghost Playback Engine extraction** (ParsekFlight 9900 → 8657 lines)
  - `GhostPlaybackEngine` (1553 lines) — extracted ghost lifecycle, per-frame rendering, loop/overlap playback, zone transitions, soft caps, reentry FX from ParsekFlight. Zero Recording references; accesses trajectories via `IPlaybackTrajectory` interface only. Fires lifecycle events (OnGhostCreated, OnPlaybackCompleted, OnLoopRestarted, etc.) for policy layer.
  - `ParsekPlaybackPolicy` (192 lines) — event subscriber handling spawn decisions, resource deltas, camera management, deferred spawn queue.
  - `IPlaybackTrajectory` interface — 19-property boundary exposing only trajectory/visual data from Recording. Enables future standalone ghost playback mod.
  - `IGhostPositioner` interface — 8 positioning methods implemented by ParsekFlight, delegates world-space placement to the host scene.
  - `GhostPlaybackEvents` — TrajectoryPlaybackFlags, FrameContext, lifecycle event types, CameraActionEvent for watch-mode decomposition.
  - 109 new tests (MockTrajectory, engine lifecycle, query API, interface isolation, log assertions)

  - `SuppressActionReplay` + `SuppressBlockingPatches` merged into single `IsReplayingActions` flag
  - `ActionReplay.ParseDetailField` removed, callers use `GameStateEventDisplay.ExtractDetailField`
  - Guard logs added to all silent early-return paths in ResourceApplicator and CrewReservationManager
- **Pass 6 — GhostPlaybackEngine decomposition** (D5, D8)
  - `ApplyFrameVisuals` extracted — deduplicates part events + flag events + reentry FX + RCS toggle from 4 call sites. `skipPartEvents` parameter preserves Site 1 semantics.
  - `RenderInRangeGhost` (~84 lines) + `HandlePastEndGhost` (~47 lines) extracted from `UpdatePlayback` loop body. Loop body reduced from ~207 to ~70 lines.
- **Pass 7 — ChainSegmentManager extraction** (T26, ParsekFlight 8657 → 8098 lines)
  - `ChainSegmentManager` (686 lines) — owns 16 chain state fields + 16 methods. ~150 field accesses migrated from ParsekFlight. `ClearAll()` replaces 13-line scattered reset.
  - Phase 1: State isolation (16 fields moved, `StopContinuation`/`StopUndockContinuation` moved)
  - Phase 2: 12 methods moved (Group A: 8 continuation methods. Group B: 4 commit methods refactored with recorder-as-parameter + bool return for abort handling)
  - `CommitSegmentCore` shared pattern (T28/D2) — stash/tag/commit/advance extracted with `Action<Recording>` callback for per-method customization. All 4 commit methods delegate to core (nullable CaptureAtStop handled for boundary splits).
  - `ClearChainIdentity()` — replaces inline 4-field reset patterns in 3 locations
  - 3 orchestration methods stay on ParsekFlight (HandleDockUndockCommitRestart, HandleChainBoardingTransition, CommitBoundaryAndRestart — own StartRecording lifecycle)
- **Pass 8 — UI dedup** (T30/D18, D19)
  - `HandleResizeDrag` + `DrawResizeHandle` static helpers — 4 drag blocks + 4 handle blocks replaced with 8 one-liner calls
  - `DrawSortableHeaderCore<TCol>` generic method — unifies `DrawSortableHeader` and `DrawSpawnSortableHeader` via `ref` sort state + `Action onChanged`. `ToggleSpawnSort` removed.
- **Pass 9 — Encapsulation** (T33)
  - `GroupHierarchyStore` accessor migration — 5 new accessor methods (`AddHiddenGroup`, `RemoveHiddenGroup`, `IsGroupHidden`, `TryGetGroupParent`, `HasGroupParent`). All ~20 ParsekUI.cs direct field accesses migrated to accessors/read-only properties.
- **Performance**
  - Per-frame `List<PartEvent>` allocations eliminated — 4 transition-check methods now append to reusable buffer (T19)
  - `TimelineGhosts` dictionary cached per-frame instead of allocating on every property access (T20)
  - `ResourceBudget.ComputeTotal` cached per-frame, shared across `DrawResourceBudget` and `DrawCompactBudgetLine` (T21)
  - Chain ghost `cachedIdx` persisted on `GhostChain` — O(n) → O(1) amortized trajectory lookup (T9)
  - `RealVesselExists` HashSet cache — O(n) linear scan → O(1) per frame with manual invalidation (T10)
- **Ghost Soft Caps** (T5)
  - `ReduceFidelity` implemented — disables 75% of renderers by index for coarse LOD silhouette
  - `SimplifyToOrbitLine` improved — hides ghost mesh with `simplified` flag, frame-skip to avoid re-processing
  - Caps-resolved branch restores fidelity and re-shows simplified ghosts
- **Audits**
  - C2: namespace consistency verified — all 73 files correct (`Parsek` or `Parsek.Patches`)
  - C3: one-class-per-file verified — 5 files have multiple types but all are acceptable data-type bundles or tightly coupled enum+class pairs
  - C4: inventory doc line counts updated to final values

### Bug Fixes

- **KSC ghost heat initialization** — KSC scene ghosts now properly start heat-animated parts in cold state. Previously, the KSC private copy of `PopulateGhostInfoDictionaries` missed the cold-state initialization that the flight scene had. Fixed by deleting the private copy and calling the shared `GhostPlaybackLogic` version.
- **Group Popup drag event leak** — Group popup window resize drag was missing `Event.current.Use()` on MouseDrag, allowing drag events to fall through to underlying windows. Fixed by extracting shared `HandleResizeDrag` helper that applies `Use()` uniformly across all 4 windows (T30/D18).
- **RestoreGhostFidelity renderer over-enable** — `RestoreGhostFidelity` previously re-enabled all renderers unconditionally, overriding part-event visibility state (decoupled/destroyed parts could reappear for one frame after soft cap resolution). Now tracks which renderers were disabled by `ReduceGhostFidelity` and only re-enables those.
- **CommitSegmentCore log index off-by-one** — Post-commit log message showed the *next* segment's index instead of the committed segment's index. Now captures index before increment.
- **ParsekUI build error** — Missing `using System` for `Action` type in `DrawSortableHeaderCore<TCol>` generic method.
- **Simplified ghost re-shown by warp-down logic** — `SimplifyToOrbitLine` soft cap hid a ghost (`activeSelf=false`, `simplified=true`), but the warp-down re-show logic saw an inactive ghost in a non-Beyond zone and re-activated it, defeating the soft cap. Fixed by adding `!state.simplified` to both re-show conditions.
- **CommitVesselSwitchTermination orphaned undock continuation** — Only cleaned up vessel continuation (`ContinuationVesselPid`) but not undock continuation. Could leave an active undock continuation until next `ClearAll()`.
- **StopContinuation incomplete reset** — Did not reset `ContinuationLastVelocity`/`ContinuationLastUT`, asymmetric with `ClearAll()` and `StopUndockContinuation`.
- **Log spam cleanup** — "Terminated chain spawn suppressed" (26k lines/session) rate-limited; "GetCachedBudget" (6.8k) rate-limited; per-save serialization logs (4k) downgraded to Verbose; explosion FX spawn log (237) downgraded to Verbose; redundant "0 segment events" log (1.8k) removed. Total ~53% reduction in Parsek log output.

### Test Suite Audit (T32)

Deep audit of all 110 test files (~55k lines). 43 files changed, +170/-1182 lines:
- 8 exact duplicate test pairs deleted

## 0.5.1

Spawn safety hardening, ghost visual improvements, booster/debris tree recording, flag planting, Fast Forward redesign, Real Spawn Control window. 20 PRs merged, 26 bugs fixed.

### Bug Fixes (Late)

- **Localization key mismatch on rewind** — stock vessels using `#autoLOC` keys (e.g., Aeris 4A stored as `#autoLOC_501176`) survived rewind vessel strip because name comparisons failed. Now resolves localization keys via `ResolveLocalizedName()` at all 4 strip/cleanup sites and all recording-creation sites (#126)
- **Collision check at wrong position** — `SpawnOrRecoverIfTooClose` checked the trajectory endpoint for collisions but `RespawnVessel` spawned at the snapshot position, allowing vessels to materialize on top of existing vessels. Now reads lat/lon/alt from the vessel snapshot for the collision check, with trajectory fallback. Also fixed in chain-tip spawn path (#127)

### Spawn Safety & Reliability

- **Bounding box collision detection** — replaced proximity-offset heuristic with oriented bounding box overlap checks against all loaded vessels (active vessel, debris, EVA, flags excluded)
- **Spawn collision retry limit** — 150-frame (~2.5s) collision block limit for non-chain spawns; walkback exhaustion flag for chain-tip spawns; spawn abandoned with WARN after limit hit (#110)
- **Spawn-die-respawn prevention** — 3-cycle death counter with permanent abandon for vessels destroyed immediately after spawn (e.g., FLYING at sea level killed by on-rails aero) (#110b)
- **Spawn abandon flag** — `SpawnAbandoned` prevents vessel-gone reset cycle from re-triggering spawn indefinitely
- **Non-leaf spawn suppression** — non-leaf tree recordings and FLYING/SUB_ORBITAL snapshot situations blocked from spawning; crew stripped from Destroyed-terminal-state spawn snapshots (#114)
- **SubOrbital terminal spawn suppression** — recordings with SubOrbital terminal state no longer attempt vessel spawn (#45)
- **Debris spawn suppression** — debris recordings (`IsDebris=true`) blocked from spawning real vessels
- **Orphaned vessel cleanup** — spawned vessels stripped from FLIGHTSTATE on revert and rewind; guards preserve already-set cleanup data on second rewind (#109)
- **ForceSpawnNewVessel on tree merge** — tree recordings correctly set ForceSpawnNewVessel during merge dialog callback, preventing PID dedup from skipping spawn after revert (#120)
- **ForceSpawnNewVessel on flight entry** — all same-PID committed recordings marked at flight entry for standalone recordings
- **Terminal state protection** — recovered/destroyed terminal state no longer corrupts committed recordings (#94)
- **Save stale data leak** — `initialLoadDone` reset on main menu transition prevents old recordings leaking into new saves with the same name (#98)

### Recording Improvements

- **Booster/debris tree recording** — `PromoteToTreeForBreakup` auto-promotes standalone recordings to trees on staging; creates root, continuation, and debris child recordings with 60s debris TTL. Continuation seeded with post-breakup points from root recording (#106 watch camera fix)
- **Controlled child recording** — `ProcessBreakupEvent` now creates child recordings for controlled children (vessels with probe cores surviving breakup), not just debris. Added to BackgroundRecorder with no TTL. Fixes RELATIVE anchor availability during playback (#61)
- **Flag planting recording/playback** — flag planting captured via `afterFlagPlanted`, stored as `FlagEvent` with position/rotation/flagUrl. Ghost flags built from stock flagPole prefab. Flags spawn as real vessels at playback end with world-space distance dedup
- **Auto-record from LANDED** — recording now triggers from LANDED state (not just PRELAUNCH) with 5-second settle timer to filter physics bounces, enabling save-loaded pad vessels and Mun takeoffs
- **Settle timer seed on vessel switch** — `lastLandedUT` seeded in `OnVesselSwitchComplete` for already-landed vessels, fixing auto-record for spawned vessels (#111)
- **Terminal engine/RCS events** — synthetic EngineShutdown, RCSStopped, and RoboticMotionStopped events emitted at recording stop for all active entries, preventing ghost plumes from persisting past recording end (#108)
- **Localization resolution** — `#autoLOC` keys resolved to human-readable names in vessel names and group headers via `Localizer.Format()` (#103)
- **Group name dedup** — multiple launches of same craft get unique group names: "Flea (2)", "Flea (3)" etc. (#104)
- **Chain boundary fix** — boundary splits skip standalone chain commits during tree mode, preventing nested groups in UI (#87)

### Ghost Visual Improvements

- **Compound part visuals** — fuel lines and struts render correctly on ghosts via PARTDATA/CModuleLinkedMesh fixup
- **Plume bubble fix** — ghost plume bubble artifacts eliminated by using KSP-native `KSPParticleEmitter.emit` via reflection instead of Unity emission module (#105)
- **Smoke trail fix** — Unity emission only disabled on FX objects that have KSPParticleEmitter; objects without it (smoke trails) keep their emission intact
- **Engine plume persistence** — `ModelMultiParticlePersistFX`/`ModelParticleFX` kept alive on ghosts for native KSP plume visuals (stripping them killed smoke trails)
- **Fairing cap** — `GenerateFairingConeMesh` generates flat disc cap when top XSECTION has non-zero radius (#85)
- **Fairing internal structure** — prefab Cap/Truss meshes permanently hidden; internal structure revealed only on `FairingJettisoned` event (#91)
- **Heat material fallback** — fallback path only clones materials that are tracked in `materialStates`, preventing red tint on non-heat parts (#86)
- **Surface ghost slide fix** — orbit segments skipped for LANDED/SPLASHED/PRELAUNCH vessels; `IsSurfaceAtUT` suppresses orbit interpolation for surface TrackSections; SMA < 90% body radius rejected (#93)
- **Terrain clamp** — ghost positions clamped above terrain in LateUpdate, preventing underground ghosts regardless of interpolation source
- **RELATIVE anchor fallback** — ghosts freeze at last known position instead of hiding when RELATIVE section anchor vessel is missing
- **Part events in Visual zone** — structural part events (fairing jettison, staging, destruction) now applied in the Visual zone (2.3-120km), not just Physics zone

### UI Improvements

- **Real Spawn Control window** — proximity-based UI showing ghosts within 500m whose recording ends in the future. Per-craft Warp button, sortable columns (Craft, Dist, Spawns at, In T-), and "Warp to Next Spawn" quick-jump button
- **Countdown column** — `T-Xd Xh Xm Xs` countdown in Recordings Manager, updates live during playback
- **Screen notification** when ghost craft enters spawn proximity range (10-second duration)
- **Toggle button** — "Real Spawn Control (N)" in main window, grayed out when no candidates nearby
- **Fast Forward redesign** — FF button performs instant UT jump forward (like time warp) instead of loading a quicksave; uses reflection for `BaseConverter.lastUpdateTime` to prevent burst resource production
- **Pinned bottom buttons** — Warp, Close, and action buttons pinned to window bottom in Actions, Recordings, and Spawn Control windows
- **Recordings window widened** — 1106 collapsed, 1324 expanded for better readability
- **Spawn abandon status** — spawn warnings show "walkback exhausted" / "spawn abandoned" status instead of silently retrying
- **Watch exit key** — changed from Backspace (conflicts with KSP Abort action group) to `[` or `]` bracket keys (#124)
- **Watch button guards** — disabled for out-of-range ghosts (tooltip: "Ghost is beyond visual range") and past recordings (#89, #90)
- **Watch overlay repositioned** — moved to left half of screen to avoid altimeter overlap

### Performance & Logging

- **CanRewind/CanFastForward log spam removed** — per-frame VERBOSE logs eliminated (was 578K lines/session, 94% of all output) (#117)
- **Main menu hook warning downgraded** — "Failed to register main menu hook" from WARN to VERBOSE (#118)
- **Spawn collision log demotion** — per-frame overlap log from Info to VerboseRateLimited (was ~24K lines/session)
- **GC allocation reduction** — per-frame allocations reduced in spawn UI via cached vessel names and eliminated redundant scans
- **Ghost FX audit** — systematic review of KSP-native component usage on ghosts; `KSPParticleEmitter` kept alive with `emit` control, `SmokeTrailControl` stripped (sets alpha to 0 on ghosts), `FXPrefab` stripped (pollutes FloatingOrigin), engine heat/RCS glow reimplementations retained (#113)
- **ParsekLog thread safety** — test overrides made thread-static to prevent cross-test pollution (#47)

### Bug Fixes

- **#45**: SubOrbital terminal state recordings no longer attempt vessel spawn
- **#47**: ParsekLog test overrides made thread-static
- **#85**: Fairing nosecone cap added to generated cone mesh
- **#86**: Heat material fallback only clones tracked materials, preventing red tint
- **#87**: Chain boundary commits no longer create nested groups in tree mode
- **#89**: Watch button disabled for ghosts beyond visual range
- **#90**: Watch button disabled for past (finished) recordings
- **#91**: Fairing internal structure hidden on ghost, revealed on jettison
- **#92**: Zone rendering tests updated for Visual-zone part events
- **#93**: Surface ghost slide fixed via orbit segment skip and SMA sanity check
- **#94**: Recovered/destroyed terminal state no longer corrupts committed recordings
- **#98**: Save data leak on same-name save recreation fixed via main menu reset
- **#103**: Localization keys resolved in vessel names and group headers
- **#104**: Multiple launches of same craft get unique group names
- **#105**: Ghost plume bubble artifacts fixed by using KSP-native emission
- **#106**: Watch camera booster fix via continuation point seeding
- **#108**: Synthetic shutdown events emitted at recording stop for all active engines/RCS
- **#109**: Spawned vessel cleanup preserved on second rewind
- **#110**: Spawn collision retry limited to 150 frames with abandon
- **#110b**: Spawn-die-respawn infinite loop stopped after 3 death cycles
- **#111**: Auto-record settle timer seeded on vessel switch
- **#114**: Non-leaf and FLYING/SUB_ORBITAL recordings blocked from spawning; crew stripped from destroyed-vessel snapshots
- **#119**: Watched ghosts exempt from zone distance hiding
- **#120**: Tree recordings set ForceSpawnNewVessel on merge
- **#61**: Controlled children now recorded after breakup (was "deferred to Phase 2")
- **#124**: Watch exit key changed from Backspace to brackets (Abort action group conflict)

---

## 0.5.0

Recording system redesign: multi-vessel sessions, ghost chain paradox prevention, spawn safety, time jump, and rendering zones. Recording format v5 → v7 (backward compatible).

### Recording System Redesign

- **Segment boundary rule** — only physical structural separation creates new segments. Controller changes, part destruction without splitting, and crew transfers are recorded as SegmentEvents within a continuing segment.
- **Crash coalescing** — rapid split events grouped into single BREAKUP BranchPoints via 0.5s window.
- **Environment taxonomy** — 5-state classification (Atmospheric, ExoPropulsive, ExoBallistic, SurfaceMobile, SurfaceStationary) with hysteresis (1s thrust, 3s surface speed, 0.5s surface/atmospheric bounce).
- **TrackSections** — typed trajectory chunks tagged with environment, reference frame, and data source.
- **Reference frames** — ABSOLUTE for physics, ORBITAL_CHECKPOINT for on-rails, RELATIVE for anchor-vessel proximity.

### Multi-Vessel Sessions

- **Background vessel recording** — all vessels in the physics bubble sampled at proximity-based rates (<200m: 5Hz, 200m-1km: 2Hz, 1-2.3km: 0.5Hz) with full part event capture.
- **Background vessel split detection** — creates tree BranchPoints + child recordings for all new vessels from separations. Debris children get 30s TTL.
- **Debris split detection** — `onPartDeCoupleNewVesselComplete` catches booster/debris vessels synchronously at decouple time. Debris trajectory recording planned for v0.5.1.
- **Highest-fidelity-wins merge** — overlapping Active/Background/Checkpoint TrackSections merged per vessel with snap-switch at boundaries.
- **Per-vessel merge dialog** — extended dialog shows per-vessel persist/ghost-only decisions.

### Relative Frames & Anchoring

- **Anchor detection** — nearest in-flight vessel with 2300m entry / 2500m exit hysteresis. Landed/splashed vessels excluded (not loaded during playback far from surface).
- **Relative recording** — offsets stored as dx/dy/dz from anchor vessel for pixel-perfect docking playback.
- **Relative playback** — ghost positioned at anchor's current world position + stored offset, FloatingOrigin-safe.
- **Loop phase tracking** — preserves phase across anchor vessel load/unload via pure arithmetic.

### Ghost Chain Paradox Prevention

- **Ghost chain model** — committed recordings that interact with pre-existing vessels (docking, undocking, etc.) cause those vessels to become ghosts from rewind until the chain tip resolves.
- **Chain walker algorithm** — scans all committed trees for vessel-claiming events, builds ordered chains, resolves cross-tree links.
- **Intermediate spawn suppression** — multi-link chains (bare-S → S+A → S+A+B) only spawn at the tip.
- **Ghost conversion** — real vessels despawned and replaced with ghost GameObjects during chain windows.
- **PID preservation** — chain-tip spawns preserve the original vessel's persistentId for cross-tree chain linking.
- **Ghosting trigger taxonomy** — structural events, orbital changes, and part state changes trigger ghosting; cosmetic events (lights) do not.

### Spawn Safety

- **Bounding box collision detection** — spawn blocked when overlapping with loaded vessels (active vessel, debris, EVA, flags excluded).
- **Ghost extension** — ghost continues on propagated orbit/surface past recording end while spawn is blocked.
- **Trajectory walkback** — for immovable blockers, walks backward along recorded trajectory to find a valid spawn position.
- **Terrain correction** — surface spawns adjusted for terrain height changes between recording and playback.

### Time Jump

- **Relative-state time jump** — discrete UT skip that advances the game clock while keeping the physics bubble frozen in place, preserving rendezvous geometry across ghost chain windows.
- **Epoch-shifted orbits** — orbital elements recomputed at the new UT from captured state vectors for Keplerian consistency.
- **TIME_JUMP SegmentEvent** — records the discontinuity for playback handling.

### Ghost World Presence

- **CommNet relay** — ghost vessels register as CommNet nodes with antenna specs from ModuleDataTransmitter, maintaining communication network coverage during ghost windows.
- **Ghost labels** — floating text labels showing vessel name, ghost status, and chain tip UT.
- **Map view / tracking station** — infrastructure stubs for ghost orbit lines and nav targets (full KSP integration pending).

### Rendering & Performance

- **Distance-based zones** — Physics (<2.3km, full fidelity), Visual (2.3-120km, mesh only), Beyond (120km+, no mesh).
- **Zone-aware playback** — per-ghost distance computation, zone transition detection, part events gated to Physics zone.
- **Ghost soft caps** — configurable thresholds with priority-based despawning (LoopedOldest first, FullTimeline kept longest). Disabled by default until profiled.
- **Settings UI** — three slider controls for cap thresholds with enable toggle and live apply.
- **Log spam mitigation** — rate-limited high-volume diagnostics (SoftCap, zone, heat, engine FX).

### Bug Fixes (70 tracked, 48 fixed)

- **#51**: Chain ID lost on vessel-switch auto-stop — proper segment commit and chain termination
- **#52**: CanRewind log spam (485K lines) — verbose removed from success path
- **#53**: Re-show log spam (16K lines) — deduplicated via loggedReshow HashSet
- **#54**: Watch mode beyond terrain range — 2s grace period then auto-exit
- **#55**: RELATIVE anchor on debris — vessel type filtering + surface skip
- **#9**: Zero-frame TrackSections from brief RELATIVE flickers — discarded
- Active TrackSections not flushed to tree recordings — FlushRecorderToTreeRecording, CreateSplitBranch, CreateMergeBranch now copy TrackSections
- Watch mode camera re-targeting — deferred spawn no longer switches camera to spawned vessel after watch mode ends at recording boundary
- Rewind save propagation fixed across tree/EVA/split paths
- Soft cap spawn-despawn loop — suppression set prevents re-spawn after cap despawn
- Zone hide vs warp re-show loop — check currentZone before re-showing
- False RELATIVE anchor at launchpad — skip anchor detection on surface
- Watch mode on beyond-range looped ghost — loop phase offset reset
- Background split children capture vessel snapshots for ghost playback
- See `docs/dev/todo-and-known-bugs.md` for full list
