    // Per-member OrbitSegment substitution for a re-aimed ghost (docs/dev/plans/
    // reaim-interplanetary-transfers.md, Phase 3). PURE: operates on OrbitSegment structs + scalars, so
    // the substitution + UT coherence is unit-testable; the live caller supplies the synthesized
    // heliocentric transfer segment (built from ReaimTransferSynthesizer's Orbit) and the member's OWN
    // recorded segments.
    //
    // MODEL (per-member heliocentric replacement). Only the heliocentric (common-ancestor / Sun) leg is
    // inertial-fixed and "misses" when replayed faithfully after the target body has moved over a synodic
    // period. The launch-body parking orbit, the target-body capture orbit, and body-fixed ascent/descent
    // are reconstructed RELATIVE to their live body (new Orbit(..., body)), so they already follow that
    // body's current position and stay correct. So re-aim replaces ONLY the heliocentric leg(s) within
    // each member that has them, leaving every other segment untouched. This handles a chained mission
    // (launch leg / transfer leg / arrival leg / debris as separate recordings) correctly: the transfer
    // member's heliocentric segments are re-aimed; the launch / arrival / debris members carry no
    // heliocentric leg and pass through faithfully (their body-relative segments follow Kerbin / Duna /
    // their parent).
    //
    // TIMELINE: the engine samples a loop member's trajectory at loopUT in [spanStart, spanEnd]
    // (GhostPlaybackLogic.TryComputeSpanLoopUT), and phaseAnchor maps the live clock to the chosen synodic
    // window. The re-aimed transfer is placed at the member's RECORDED [recordedDepartureUT,
    // recordedArrivalUT] (the SOI-exit -> target-SOI-entry window) with the recorded tof, so it fits the
    // member's recorded timeline exactly. What varies PER WINDOW is only the transfer orbit's INERTIAL
    // ORIENTATION (inc/LAN/argPe, aiming at the target's actual position at that window) and its epoch -
    // which the live caller shifts into recorded-span time before calling here.
