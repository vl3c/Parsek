## Rewind to Staging — v0.9 carryover follow-ups

The feature itself shipped on `feat/rewind-staging` across the v0.9 cycle (design: `docs/parsek-rewind-to-staging-design.md`; pre-implementation spec archived at `docs/dev/done/parsek-rewind-staging-design.md`; roadmap + CHANGELOG under v0.9.0). The three carryover items below are tracked in the design doc under Known Limitations / Future Work and are not yet addressed:

- Index-to-recording-id refactor to lift the 13 grep-audit exemptions added in Phase 3.
- Halt `EffectiveRecordingId` walk at cross-tree boundaries (v1 does not produce cross-tree supersedes; latent-invariant guard).
- Wider v2 tombstone scope (contracts, milestones) when safe.

# Known Bugs

## ~~570. Warp-deferred survivor spawn stayed queued outside the active vessel's physics bubble~~

**Source:** `logs/2026-04-25_1314_marker-validator-fix/KSP.log`. Recording #15
`"Kerbal X"` was queued by `Deferred spawn during warp` at line 537676, then
`FlushDeferredSpawns` kept it queued outside the active vessel's physics bubble
1815 times through line 541400.

**Cause:** the deferred spawn queue correctly waits while warp is active, but the
post-warp flush reused active-vessel physics-bubble scoping. That is wrong for a
finished terminal survivor: once warp is inactive, the materialization path can
place the real vessel at its recorded endpoint. Keeping the spawn queued only
made it wait forever unless the active vessel moved within 2.3 km.

**Fix:** `ParsekPlaybackPolicy.FlushDeferredSpawns` now executes pending spawn
items once warp is inactive instead of re-checking `ShouldDeferSpawnOutsideBubble`.
Failed flag replays remain queued as before. Regression
`DeferredSpawnTests.FlushDeferredSpawns_SpawnsQueuedSplashedSurvivorAfterWarpEnds`
pins the splashed-survivor case from the log.

**Status:** CLOSED 2026-04-25. Fixed for v0.9.0.

## 547. Recording optimizer should surface cross-body exo segments more clearly than the current first-body label

**Source:** `docs/dev/recording-optimizer-review.md` (2026-04-07), especially the traced Kerbin-launch-to-Mun-landing scenario.

**Concern:** the optimizer only splits on environment-class changes, not body changes, so a long exo segment can legitimately span Kerbin orbit, transfer coast, and Mun orbit while still inheriting `SegmentBodyName` from its first trajectory point. The current result is structurally correct and loopable, but the player-facing label can still read like a lie (`Kerbin` even though the recording includes Mun orbit time). We need a deliberate decision here instead of leaving it as an accidental quirk: either keep the single exo segment and surface a multi-body label (`Kerbin -> Mun`), or introduce an optional body-change split criterion if that proves clearer in practice.

**Files:** `Source/Parsek/RecordingOptimizer.cs`, `Source/Parsek/RecordingStore.cs`, timeline/recordings UI that renders `SegmentBodyName`, `docs/dev/recording-optimizer-review.md`.

**Status:** TODO. Likely UX/research follow-up, not a v0.8.3 ship blocker.

---

## 548. Static background continuations and all-boring surface leaf segments should not read like empty ghost recordings

**Source:** `docs/dev/recording-optimizer-review.md` (2026-04-07), issues 1 and 2.

**Concern:** two related outputs are still structurally correct but awkward in the player-facing recordings list:
- stationary landed background continuations can end up as `SurfacePosition`/time-range placeholders with no real ghost trail
- all-boring surface leaf segments can survive optimizer trim because they still carry the final `VesselSnapshot`/spawn responsibility

Both cases are valid data, but they clutter the UI and read like broken/empty ghosts. We should either collapse them visually, mark them explicitly as static/stationary, or trim them to a minimal terminal window while preserving their structural role.

**Files:** `Source/Parsek/BackgroundRecorder.cs`, `Source/Parsek/RecordingOptimizer.cs`, recordings/timeline UI that lists committed segments, `docs/dev/recording-optimizer-review.md`.

**Status:** TODO. UX cleanup / follow-up analysis.

## 549. Recording optimizer needs end-to-end branch-point coverage when tree recordings are split post-commit

**Source:** `docs/dev/recording-optimizer-review.md` (2026-04-07), issue 5.

**Concern:** the optimizer has unit coverage for split logic, but we still do not have a full tree-with-branch-points regression that proves post-commit environment splits preserve the intended branch linkage and chain navigation shape. The review did not find a live bug here, but this is exactly the seam most likely to regress silently when optimizer logic or branch-point rewrites change.

**Files:** `Source/Parsek.Tests/RecordingOptimizer*`, `Source/Parsek.Tests/RecordingStore*`, any integration-style optimizer/tree fixture that exercises `RunOptimizationPass` on a multi-stage tree with branch points.

**Status:** TODO. Medium-priority coverage gap.

## 435. Multi-recording Gloops trees (main + debris + crew children, no vessel spawn)

**Source:** world-model conversation on #432 (2026-04-17). The aspirational design for Gloops: when the player records a Gloops flight that stages or EVAs, the capture produces a **tree of ghost-only recordings** — main + debris children + crew children — all flagged `IsGhostOnly`, all grouped under a per-flight Gloops parent in the Recordings Manager, and none of them spawning a real vessel at ghost-end. Structurally the same as the normal Parsek recording tree (decouple → debris background recording, EVA → linked crew child), with the ghost-only flag applied uniformly and the vessel-spawn-at-end path skipped.

**Guiding architectural principle:** per `docs/dev/gloops-recorder-design.md`, Gloops is on track to be extracted as a standalone mod on which Parsek will depend. Parsek's recorder and tree infrastructure will become the base that both Gloops and Parsek share — Gloops exposes the trajectory recorder + playback engine, Parsek layers the career-state / tree / DAG / world-presence envelope on top via the `IPlaybackTrajectory` boundary. Multi-recording Gloops must therefore **reuse Parsek's existing recorder, tree, and BackgroundRecorder infrastructure** rather than growing a parallel Gloops-flavored implementation. The ghost-only distinction is a per-recording flag on top of shared machinery, not a separate code path.

**2026-04-19 boundary note:** `GhostPlaybackEngine.ResolveGhostActivationStartUT` no longer casts back to `Recording`; the engine now resolves activation start from playable payload bounds through `PlaybackTrajectoryBoundsResolver` over `IPlaybackTrajectory`. #435 remains otherwise unchanged, but this leak is no longer part of the extraction risk surface.

**Current state (audited 2026-04-17):**

- `gloopsRecorder` is a **parallel** `FlightRecorder` instance with no `ActiveTree` (`ParsekFlight.cs:7460`) — a temporary workaround that the extraction direction wants to retire.
- `BackgroundRecorder` is never initialized in the Gloops path — only alongside `activeTree` for normal recordings. Staging during a Gloops flight does not produce a debris child.
- `FlightRecorder.HandleVesselSwitchDuringRecording` auto-stops Gloops on any vessel switch (`FlightRecorder.cs:5143-5151`), so EVA does not produce a linked crew child either.
- `RecordingStore.CommitGloopsRecording` accepts a single `Recording`, adds it to the flat `"Gloops - Ghosts Only"` group (`RecordingStore.cs:394-418`). No `CommitGloopsTree`, no nested group structure.
- No conditional `IsGloopsMode` branch inside `RecordingTree`, no half-finished Gloops tree scaffolding.

**Net: Gloops is strictly single-recording by design today**, implemented as a parallel workaround. Multi-recording Gloops is a separate, sizable feature that should also consolidate Gloops onto the shared Parsek recorder (retire the parallel `gloopsRecorder` path).

**Desired behavior:**

- Gloops uses Parsek's main `FlightRecorder` + `RecordingTree` + `BackgroundRecorder` path, with a tree-level `IsGhostOnly` flag propagated to every leaf at commit. No parallel `gloopsRecorder`.
- Starting a Gloops recording creates a `RecordingTree` with the ghost-only flag; normal recording continues alongside on the same machinery if already active, or the tree operates solo if not. How the two modes interleave in the UI (explicit toggle, implicit based on UI state, etc.) is for the implementing PR to decide — possibly in coordination with a UI gate preventing concurrent career + Gloops capture.
- Staging during a Gloops flight → debris gets its own ghost-only recording via the normal `BackgroundRecorder` split path, with `IsGhostOnly = true` inherited from the tree.
- EVA during a Gloops flight → linked child ghost-only recording via the normal EVA split path.
- Commit: the whole Gloops tree flushes as a nested group under `"Gloops - Ghosts Only"` — e.g. `"Gloops - Ghosts Only / Mk3 Airshow Flight"` with child debris / crew recordings under it. Every leaf is `IsGhostOnly`.
- No vessel-spawn-at-end for any recording in a Gloops tree. `GhostPlaybackLogic.ShouldSpawnAtRecordingEnd` already gates on `!rec.IsGhostOnly` (see `GhostPlaybackLogic.cs:3001`); the tree case reuses this.
- Per-recording delete / regroup / rename in the Recordings Manager works the same as normal trees.
- Apply-side: #432's filter reads `rec.IsGhostOnly` per-recording, so every leaf in a Gloops tree is already excluded from the ledger with no extra work.

**Files likely to touch (sketch, not exhaustive):**

- `Source/Parsek/ParsekFlight.cs` — retire `gloopsRecorder` in favor of the main `recorder`/`activeTree` path; the "Start Gloops" action creates a tree flagged ghost-only. `CheckGloopsAutoStoppedByVesselSwitch` goes away or is folded into normal tree commit.
- `Source/Parsek/FlightRecorder.cs` — remove `IsGloopsMode` branches once the parallel recorder is retired; the recorder becomes agnostic to career semantics (aligning with the extraction boundary in `gloops-recorder-design.md`).
- `Source/Parsek/BackgroundRecorder.cs` — carry a tree-level ghost-only flag so debris children inherit it.
- `Source/Parsek/RecordingStore.cs` — collapse `CommitGloopsRecording` into the normal tree commit path; the ghost-only distinction is per-tree (or per-leaf, if partial-Gloops trees ever become a thing, which they shouldn't).
- `Source/Parsek/UI/GloopsRecorderUI.cs` — controls now drive the main recorder with a ghost-only flag rather than spinning up a parallel instance.
- `Source/Parsek.Tests/` — tree-structural tests for multi-recording Gloops capture and commit.

**Dependencies / sequencing:**

- Ships after #432 (which closes the existing single-recording leak and establishes the per-recording `IsGhostOnly` apply-side filter that multi-recording Gloops will rely on).
- Coordinates loosely with the Gloops extraction work (`docs/dev/gloops-recorder-design.md` Section 11 — the extraction sequence); ideally this consolidation happens before extraction so the extraction moves a single unified recorder, not two.
- Not tied to the deterministic-timeline correctness cluster — this is a feature extension, not a correctness bug.

**Out of scope:**

- Making Gloops spawn real vessels at ghost-end (explicitly not wanted — Gloops is visual-only).
- Turning the existing single-recording Gloops path into a tree retroactively for existing saves (beta, restart the save if you want the new behavior).
- Actually extracting Gloops into its own mod. That's covered by `docs/dev/gloops-recorder-design.md`'s extraction plan. #435 is a preparatory consolidation step on the Parsek side.

**Priority:** Medium. Feature extension + architectural cleanup. Worth scoping after #432 lands.

**Status:** TODO. Size: L. New feature — not a follow-up to anything shipped today.

## 430. "Why is this blocked?" explainer for the committed-action dialog

**Source:** follow-up on the "paradox communication" thread — currently when the player tries to re-research a tech or re-upgrade a facility that's already committed to a future timeline event, `CommittedActionDialog` pops up with a short "Blocked action: X — reason" message. The reason is generic and the player has no way to see *which* committed action is causing the block, or *when* it will play out.

**Desired behavior:**

- Replace the one-line reason with a structured block:
  - The action the player tried (e.g. "Research node: Heavier Rocketry").
  - The committed action that blocks it, including the source recording and its UT (e.g. "Already scheduled at UT 183420 in recording 'Mun Lander 3'").
  - A `Go to Timeline` button that opens the Timeline window and scrolls to the offending entry (reuses `TimelineWindowUI.ScrollToRecording`).
  - A `Revert to launch` shortcut if the player actually wants to undo it (routes to the existing rewind dialog pre-filled with the blocking recording).
- Keep the OK/close path unchanged so existing muscle memory still works.

**Why it matters:**

The mental model of "you can't do this because the timeline already did" is counter-intuitive for a first-time player. Showing the *which* and *when* turns a mysterious block into a debuggable constraint, reinforcing the ledger-as-truth principle every time a block fires.

**Files to touch:**

- `Source/Parsek/CommittedActionDialog.cs` — extend the dialog body; accept an optional `blockingRecordingId` + `blockingUT` + `blockingAction` tuple.
- `Source/Parsek/Patches/*Patch.cs` (where blocks are triggered for tech research / facility upgrade / part purchase) — pass the conflict context into the dialog instead of just the short reason string.
- `Source/Parsek/UI/TimelineWindowUI.cs` — already has `ScrollToRecording`; no changes beyond what's there.

**Out of scope for v1:**

- Auto-resolving the block by rewinding silently; this stays an informational dialog, not a one-click rewind.
- Collapsing multiple overlapping blocks into a summary (each block fires its own dialog as today).

**Status:** TODO. Size: S-M. Best quality-per-effort of the paradox-comms work.

## 428. Preview-rewind pane

**Source:** follow-up on the "cost-of-rewind is hard to intuit" thread. Rewind is the most consequential single action in Parsek — it moves the player back to a chosen launch point and replays forward with existing ghosts. But right now the rewind confirmation dialog shows a single summary line ("Rewind to 'Mun Lander 3' at Y1 D23?") and a raw count of "how many future recordings exist". A player can't tell before confirming: which exact recordings will be preserved, which will be replayed, which resources / contracts / milestones will be re-rolled, whether crew reservations will shift.

**Desired behavior:**

- Replace the existing one-line confirmation with a two-pane preview dialog anchored on the rewind button.
- Left pane: **"Before rewind point"** — committed recordings whose `EndUT <= rewindTargetUT` (stay intact on the ledger and their ledger effects remain applied); game-action milestones that already fired before the target; crew reservations that complete before the target.
- Right pane: **"Re-rolled forward"** — committed recordings whose `StartUT > rewindTargetUT` (they stay committed; their resource deltas + events re-apply from the target UT forward as the player plays); milestones pending at UT > target (they'll re-fire); crew reservations spanning the target (stand-in chain resets).
- Each pane shows a count + a preview list of the first ~5 items with `...and N more` if longer.
- Confirm / Cancel buttons unchanged.

**Why it matters:**

Rewind currently feels like a commitment to the unknown — the player isn't sure what they'll lose. Making the consequences legible before the dialog closes reduces regret and teaches the two buckets (before / re-rolled), which is the honest mental model: rewind is deterministic replay, nothing is thrown away.

**Files to touch:**

- `Source/Parsek/UI/RewindConfirmationUI.cs` (new or extension of the existing confirmation helper — current code is inlined in `RecordingsTableUI.ShowRewindConfirmation`).
- A `RewindPreview.Build(recordings, ledgerActions, milestones, rewindTargetUT, liveUT)` pure helper that classifies each item as "before rewind point" or "re-rolled forward". Lives next to `TimelineBuilder` since both walk similar data.
- Tests: classification helper fully covered (happy path + each bucket's edge cases + an item spanning the target UT).

**Out of scope for v1:**

- Previewing the new resource balance after rewind. Just show counts + first few items.
- Undo for rewind. One-way operation stays one-way.

**Status:** TODO. Size: M-L. Biggest UX win per dollar on the rewind mechanic.

## 427. Proactive paradox warnings surface

**Source:** follow-up on the conversation after shipping the Career State window. Today the mod prevents paradoxes mostly via blocks (action-blocked dialog) and a single red over-committed warning in the Timeline's resource footer. There's no centralized surface that says "your committed timeline has these N potential issues" — so a player can build up a career with, e.g., a contract that expires before its committed completion, or a facility upgrade requiring a level that won't be reached in time, and only discover the contradiction when it fires (or silently zeroes out).

**Desired behavior:**

- A **Warnings** badge on the main ParsekUI button row — hidden when count is 0, shown as `Warnings (N)` when any warning rules fire.
- Clicking opens a small scrollable window listing each warning as a row:
  - Category tag (`Contract`, `Facility`, `Strategy`, `Resource`, `Crew`).
  - One-line description (`Contract "Rescue Kerbal" deadline UT 240000 is before committed completion at UT 250000`).
  - `Go to ...` button linking to the relevant other window (Timeline scroll, Career State tab, etc.).
- Warnings are computed once per `OnTimelineDataChanged` fan-out (same cache-invalidation channel everything else uses).
- Starter rule set, each as a pure static helper in `WarningRules.cs`:
  - **ContractDeadlineMissed** — active contract's `DeadlineUT < terminal-UT of its committed completion recording`.
  - **FacilityLevelRequirement** — an action requires facility level N but the facility doesn't reach N until after that action's UT.
  - **StrategySlotOverflow** — projected active strategies > projected max slots (currently only warned in log, not UI).
  - **ContractSlotOverflow** — same for contracts.
  - **CrewDoubleBooking** — a stand-in appears in two chains at overlapping UT ranges.
  - **ResourceOverCommit** — already shown in Timeline budget footer, but also listed here for one-stop-shop.

**Why it matters:**

Action blocking catches paradoxes at the moment the player tries to violate them. Warnings catch *latent* contradictions that the ledger can detect but won't error on — the subtle ones where the ledger silently picks a resolution the player didn't intend (e.g. contract gets zeroed out because its deadline passed unexpectedly). Surfacing these early turns the mod's "structural paradox prevention" into a communicated design contract rather than a hidden invariant.

**Files to touch:**

- `Source/Parsek/UI/WarningsWindowUI.cs` — new scrollable list window.
- `Source/Parsek/WarningRules.cs` — new pure-static rule evaluators, one method per rule, each returning `List<Warning>` given `(ledger, recordings, modules)`. Heavy unit-test coverage.
- `Source/Parsek/ParsekUI.cs` — add the badge button + open toggle; integrate with `OnTimelineDataChanged` cache invalidation.
- `Source/Parsek.Tests/WarningRulesTests.cs` — one test per rule (happy + each flag condition).

**Out of scope for v1:**

- Auto-fix for any warning. Pure read-only surface.
- Severity levels / color-coding. All warnings are equal in v1; add severity in a follow-up if there are too many of one kind.
- Per-rule disable toggles. Playtesting can decide which rules feel noisy before we add knobs.

**Status:** TODO. Size: M. Complements the help popup (#426) — where help explains the system, warnings explain *your career's* specific issues. Together they turn the mod from "learn by experimenting" to "learn by seeing the model."

## 426. In-window help popups explaining each Parsek system

**Source:** follow-up conversation during the #416 UI polish pass. A player unfamiliar with the mod has to read `docs/user-guide.md` (out of the game) to understand what each window's sections and columns mean. The mechanics are specific enough (slots vs. stand-ins vs. reservations, per-recording fates, timeline tiers, resource budget semantics, etc.) that even tooltips-on-hover don't carry the full picture. An in-game help surface keeps the explanation next to the thing it explains.

**Desired behavior:**

- A small `?` icon button rendered in the title bar (or as the last button in the main toolbar row) of each Parsek window: Recordings, Timeline, Kerbals, Career State, Real Spawn Control, Gloops Flight Recorder, Settings.
- Clicking the `?` opens a small modal-ish popup window titled `Parsek - {Window} Help` anchored next to the parent window.
- The popup body is static help text tailored to that window. For tabbed windows (Kerbals, Career State), the help content should also cover each tab, either as one scrolling document or as a small tab-match sub-structure inside the popup. Keep each section brief (5-15 sentences) — the goal is orientation, not exhaustive docs.
- A "Close" button and `GUI.DragWindow()` so the popup can be moved.
- Help text can be hard-coded string constants in `Source/Parsek/UI/HelpContent/` (one file per window). No runtime load, no localization for v1.
- Suggested starter content:
  - **Recordings** — column-by-column walkthrough, L/R/FF/W/Hide button meanings, group vs chain vs ghost-only distinction.
  - **Timeline** — Overview vs Details tiers, Recordings/Actions/Events source toggles, time-range filter, resource-budget footer, loop toggle semantics on entry rows, GoTo cross-link.
  - **Kerbals** — slots vs stand-ins vs reservations (Roster State tab), chronological outcomes per kerbal (Mission Outcomes tab), outcome-click-scrolls-Timeline.
  - **Career State** — contracts / strategies / facilities / milestones tabs, current-vs-projected columns when the timeline holds pending recordings, Mission Control / Administration slot math.
  - **Real Spawn Control** — what it does (warp-to-vessel-spawn), State column, 500m proximity trigger.
  - **Gloops** — ghost-only manual recording, loop-by-default commit, X delete button in Recordings.
  - **Settings** — group-by-group overview (Recording, Looping, Ghosts, Diagnostics, Recorder Sample Density, Data Management); call out Auto-merge, Auto-launch, Camera cutoff, Show-ghosts-in-Tracking-Station.

**Out of scope for v1:**

- Inline tooltips on every sub-control (hover-tooltips already exist for a few buttons; expanding them is a separate follow-up).
- Localization / translation.
- Interactive tutorials.
- Search within help content.
- External hyperlinks (no browser launch from KSP IMGUI reliably).

**Files to touch:**

- New: `Source/Parsek/UI/HelpWindowUI.cs` (shared small popup window; takes a `windowKey` + body-text source).
- New: `Source/Parsek/UI/HelpContent/*.cs` (one static class per window, each exposes `public const string Body` or a `BuildBody()` method if dynamic content is needed later).
- Each existing window UI file (RecordingsTableUI, TimelineWindowUI, KerbalsWindowUI, CareerStateWindowUI, SpawnControlUI, GloopsRecorderUI, SettingsWindowUI): add a small `?` button and an `IsHelpOpen` toggle that feeds HelpWindowUI.
- `ParsekUI.cs`: add a single shared `HelpWindowUI` field + accessor so every window delegates to the same instance (only one popup open at a time).
- `CHANGELOG.md` entry under Unreleased.
- `docs/user-guide.md` can mention the new `?` buttons briefly but stays as the authoritative long-form reference.

**Status:** TODO. Size: M. Style it the same way as the rest of the mod (shared section headers, dark list box for paragraph groups, pressed toggle idiom if any sub-tabs appear).

## 160. Log spam: remaining sources after ComputeTotal removal

After removing ResourceBudget.ComputeTotal logging (52% of output), remaining spam sources:
- GhostVisual HIERARCHY/DIAG dumps (~344 lines per session, rate-limited per-key but burst on build)
- GhostVisual per-part cloning details (~370 lines)
- Flight "applied heat level Cold" (46 lines, logs no-change steady state)
- RecordingStore SerializeTrackSections per-recording verbose (184 lines)
- KSCSpawn "Spawn not needed" at INFO level (54 lines)
- BgRecorder CheckpointAllVessels checkpointed=0 at INFO (15 lines)

**Priority:** Deferred to Phase 11.5 (Recording Optimization & Observability)

**Status:** Open

## TODO — Release & Distribution

### T3. CKAN metadata

Create a `.netkan` file or submit to CKAN indexer so users can install Parsek via CKAN. Requires a stable release URL pattern.

**Priority:** Nice-to-have

---

## TODO — Performance & Optimization

### T61. Continue Phase 11.5 recording storage shrink work

The first five storage slices are in place: representative fixture coverage, `v1` section-authoritative `.prec` sidecars, alias-mode ghost snapshot dedupe, header-dispatched binary `v2` `.prec` sidecars, exact sparse `v3` defaults for stable per-point body/career fields, and lossless header-dispatched `Deflate` compression for `_vessel.craft` / `_ghost.craft` snapshot sidecars with legacy-text fallback. Current builds also keep a default-on readable `.txt` mirror path for `.prec` / `_vessel.craft` / `_ghost.craft` so binary-comparison debugging can happen without unpacking the authoritative files first.

Remaining high-value work should stay measurement-gated and follow `docs/dev/done/plans/phase-11-5-recording-storage-optimization.md`:

- any further snapshot-side work now has to clear a higher bar: `.prec` and `_ghost.craft` are already roughly equal buckets after compression, and `_vessel.craft` is small, so "focus on snapshots next" only applies if a future corpus shifts the split back toward snapshots
- keep the readable mirror path strictly diagnostic: authoritative load/save stays on `.prec` / `.craft`, mirror failures stay non-fatal, and stale mirrors should continue to reconcile cleanly on flag changes
- only pursue intra-save snapshot dedupe or any custom binary snapshot schema if a future rebaseline against a larger / more vessel-heavy corpus shows a meaningful measured win
- additional sparse payload work only where exact reconstruction and real byte wins are proven
- post-commit, error-bounded trajectory thinning only after the format wins are re-measured
- snapshot-only hydration salvage must keep the loaded disk trajectory authoritative; if pending-tree data is used to heal bad snapshot sidecars, it should restore only snapshot state, not overwrite trajectory/timing with future in-memory data
- out-of-band `incrementEpoch=false` sidecar writes still rely on the existing `.sfs` epoch and staged per-file replacement; if we ever need crash-proof mixed-generation detection there, add a sidecar-set commit marker/manifest instead of pretending the current epoch gate can prove it
- any further snapshot-side work should preserve current alias semantics, keep the missing-only ghost fallback contract, keep partial-write rollback safety intact, and stay covered by sidecar/load diagnostics

**Priority:** Current Phase 11.5 follow-on work — measurement-gated guidance for future shrink work rather than active tasks

## TODO — Ghost Visuals

### T25. Fairing internal truss structure after jettison

After fairing jettison, the ghost currently shows just the payload and base adapter. KSP's real vessel can show an internal truss structure (Cap/Truss meshes controlled by `ModuleStructuralNodeToggle.showMesh`). The prefab meshes are at placeholder scale (2000x10x2000) that only KSP's runtime `ModuleProceduralFairing` can set correctly. A procedural truss mesh was attempted but removed due to insufficient visual quality.

Latest investigation: a second procedural-truss attempt was tested against fresh collected logs in `logs/2026-04-13_1529_fairing-truss-artifact`. The run correctly detected `FairingJettisoned` and rebuilt the ghost with `showMesh=True`, but the generated truss still looked bad in game: visible dark bars with transparent gaps following the fairing outline from base to tip. This confirms the simplified procedural replacement is still not shippable.

Important constraint: the current ghost snapshot is just a normal `ProtoVessel`/`ConfigNode` capture (`BackupVessel` output copied into `GhostVisualSnapshot`). That preserves fairing state such as `fsm`, `ModuleStructuralNodeToggle.showMesh`, and `XSECTION`, but it does not preserve the live runtime-generated stock Cap/Truss mesh deformation/material state from `ModuleProceduralFairing`. So the ghost cannot reproduce the exact stock truss visual from snapshot data alone.

To implement properly: prefer a stock-authoritative approach instead of another simplified procedural mesh. Most likely options are either capturing the live stock fairing truss render/mesh state at record time, or spawning/regenerating a hidden stock fairing from the snapshot and cloning the resulting stock truss renderers for the ghost. Only fall back to custom geometry if it can genuinely match stock quality.

**Status:** Open — do not revive the current simplified procedural-strip truss

**Priority:** Low — cosmetic, only visible briefly after fairing jettison

## TODO — Compatibility

### T43. Mod compatibility testing (CustomBarnKit, Strategia, Contract Configurator)

Test game actions system with popular mods: CustomBarnKit (non-standard facility tiers may break level conversion formula), Strategia (different strategy IDs/transform mechanics), Contract Configurator (contract snapshot round-trip across CC versions). Requires KSP runtime with mods installed. Investigation notes in `docs/dev/mod-compatibility-notes.md`.

**Priority:** Last phase of roadmap — v1 targets stock only, mod compat is best-effort
