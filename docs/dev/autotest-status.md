# Automated Testing System - Status

Last updated: 2026-07-24 (EVA-4-atmo-chute FLEW ITS FIRST FLIGHT and
ASSERT-FAILed exactly as designed - fast, self-explaining, no budget burn:
"eva-window-missed: altitude 702m fell below the window floor 800m (vspeed
-295.2m/s, ... craftChute armed)". Root-caused from the measured per-frame
profile + the produced recording + decompiled ModuleParachute: arming the
craft's chute at 2500 m is INERT, not late - the fixture persists
automateSafeDeploy=0 and stock never opens a chute at ~300 m/s in dense air, so
the recording carries ZERO Parachute* events. Re-tuned to arm at the APOAPSIS
crossing, raise the stock full-deploy altitude, and gate the EVA window on the
chute's OBSERVED kRPC state instead of the machine's own "we commanded it"
latch. Re-fly pending. Prior: EVA-4-atmo-chute lands, NEVER FLOWN: the first
ATMOSPHERIC mid-flight EVA case - new seam verb `EvaChuteDeploy` [the kerbal
personal parachute, driving the same public `ModuleEvaChute.Deploy()` both
stock player paths call] + new mission `eva4_atmo_chute` whose terminal is an
AIRBORNE EVA window rather than a landing, reusing the committed b1-pad-craft
fixture. Claims the previously-unclaimed D7 chute-two-phase cell. Awaits its
first live flight. Prior: FORGE-eva2-lko lands: the FIRST ORBITAL fixture-forge
[mission forge_lko] that stamps the crewed-LKO fixture EVA-2 is waiting on, so
EVA-2-orbital-board's only remaining gate is the operator forge run + harvest.
Prior: H6-route-rewind-timeline LIVE-PROVEN on its first live
run - FULL PASS attempt 1, all seven verifiers green - the route-rewind wave's
last automated acceptance item; EVA-1-pad-flag first flight = EvaExit/EvaBoard/
commit chain green + analyzer clean, three PlantFlag/EvaExit defects found +
fixed across flights 1-3 [live CanPlantFlag() gate read; verified ladder
release; and the seam now waits for the SiteRename popup before answering so
afterFlagPlanted fires + the FlagEvent is captured]). Prior: EVA lane
prep - PR #1345 review follow-ups 1-5 all addressed; crew-by-name + launch_site
plumbing threaded; FORGE-eva3-pad forge spec + harvest path land; EVA
batch-autorun evaluated = NOT wired; 2026-07-23 M-C2 EVA verbs + EVA-1/2/3 specs;
B-DOCK dock/transfer/undock lane + fixture-forge; all headless-green. This file
is the single at-a-glance answer
to "what is done, what is proven, what is gated" for the automated testing
initiative, so nobody has to re-derive status from code.

## Purpose - never forget it

This system exists for exactly one reason: MAKING PARSEK BETTER. Every
mission, verb, and scenario is an instrument for verifying Parsek's behavior
- that recordings are correct, complete, and schema-clean; that the ledger
reproduces career state exactly; that rewind/re-fly, playback, ghosts, and
routes survive real flight histories. Flying rockets is never the point: a
mission earns its place only by the Parsek recording/ledger/rewind surface it
exercises. The end goal is the L-track Ledger Accuracy Campaign (grand oracle
career runs with repeated rewinds, oracle-diffed at every session boundary).
When prioritizing work, ask "what Parsek defect class does this catch?" -
that question has already paid: the initiative's first real catches include
the INV2 double-cover recorder seam defect and the S0.5 orphan-sidecar leak.

## Doc map (no duplicate documentation)

Each fact about this system lives in exactly one place:

| Doc | Owns |
|---|---|
| THIS FILE | Status: what is shipped, proven, gated; roadmap order |
| `automated-testing-plan.md` | Strategy + rationale (why the system is shaped this way; L-track definition) |
| `automated-testing-scenario-catalog.md` | The INTENDED universe: dimension registry D1-D18 vocabulary, scenario blocks, tiers, regression rotation |
| `design-autotest-*.md` (12 docs) | Per-module design authority (how each module works; binding contracts) |
| `harness/README.md` | Harness module mechanics: ownership boundary, how to run, submodule readiness |
| `todo-and-known-bugs.md` | Finding forensics: the full evidence trail behind every live finding |
| `harness/coverage/registry.toml` | The machine-readable coverage denominator (authoritative cell list) |

If a status statement appears anywhere else, it is a pointer to this file or
it is wrong. MAINTENANCE RULE: any PR that changes a module's status,
live-proves a scenario, adds a test case, or opens/closes a gate updates this
file in the same PR (same discipline as CHANGELOG).

## One-paragraph summary

The system flies KSP missions unattended (kRPC + MechJeb autopilot, or the
Parsek file-drop command seam), records them with Parsek, and verifies the
result through a seven-verifier chain (driver validity, in-game test batch,
offline recording analyzer, log validation, results schema, anomaly sweep,
expectations). Ten test cases are live-proven green end-to-end, including
Mun/Minmus/Duna flybys with a certified no-1x-coast warp profile. All
infrastructure modules are shipped and merged. The FIRST two-vessel lane
(B-DOCK: dock/transfer/undock, the logistics-route recording entry point) is
IMPLEMENTED and headless-green, pending a headless fixture-forge run + its
first flight. Coverage stands at 52 of 238 registry cells - breadth (EVA,
orbit, landing, docking, career-ledger lanes) is the frontier.

## Test cases (all 28 committed scenarios)

LIVE-PROVEN = at least one fully-unattended PASS with every verifier green.
The "Parsek surface verified" column is the reason the case exists.

### Committed, not yet live-run (13)

| Test case | Tier | Parsek surface verified | Blocker |
|---|---|---|---|
| BDOCK-1-station-interceptor | nightly | FIRST two-vessel flight (18-phase machine): cross-tree Dock branch, authoritative onVesselsUndocking split, RouteConnectionWindow recorded-delta contract (the new `Route window delta:` line), same-craft-twice launch identity. Flight-1/2 wall budgets re-timed; flight-3 lesson (STATION-SEPARATE / INT-SEPARATE) + flight-4 lesson (two-step SEPARATE: drop the spent lifter AND ignite the orbital engine, thrust-verified, cap 2) both live-confirmed through RENDEZVOUS on flight 5; flight-5 lesson (MATCH-VELOCITY kill-rel-vel retargeted XFromNow ~15 s lead + bounded 600 s give-up + per-frame diagnostics + one-shot dropped-target re-acquire); flight-8 lesson (prox-ops rule: abort the pending kill-rel-vel node executor at DOCK entry before the docking AP owns the ship, else it rails-warps + packs the port target null + NREs); flight-9 lesson (core.target one-Update sync trap: stagger the docking-AP enable one poll after the port target); flight-10/11 lesson (prox-ops observability [angular_velocity/sas/rcs/docking_ap_status + per-frame DOCK diag line] + attitude hold [SAS+RCS after each separation and at DOCK entry] + LIVENESS watchdogs [budgets bound SLOW, watchdogs bound BROKEN: DOCK enable-never-took / died-mid-approach / no-progress fast flakes, TRANSFER stall fast flake, bounded dropped-target re-arm x3]). flight-13 ROOT CAUSE (behind every dock failure since flight 7): pre-`launch_vessel`-reload PART handles are stale - the reload destroys every Part, so the captured docking-port handle resolves to a destroyed part and assigning it silently CLEARS the target; VESSEL handles survive (P9 answered). Fix: resolve port + docking-state + transfer tanks LIVE at call time. Flight 13's liveness layer fast-flaked in 10 s with the named E1a reason (wall 2133 s) and pinned this. Flight 16 (2026-07-24): MISSION-OK END TO END (launch, separate, mid-mission commit seam, launch_vessel, rendezvous, hard dock, LF 40 + mono 15 transfers, undock, TERMINAL) - and the verifier chain caught the FIRST mission-machinery-found Parsek recording defect: analyzer RED, INV4-PARTEVENT-PID x13 on the Station recording d5355cc6. Root cause: the launch_vessel FLIGHT->FLIGHT reload is classified as a quickload (stale vesselSwitchPending), and RestoreActiveTreeFromPending's NAME fallback adopted the fresh-rollout Interceptor (same .craft, same "Kerbal X" name, different Vessel.id) and PID-remapped the Station recording onto it, so the whole Interceptor flight recorded into the Station recording with foreign craft-baked part pids. FIXED Parsek-side: QuickloadResumeMatchGuard (fresh-rollout pid + launch-guid gates in the restore match loop); forensics in todo-and-known-bugs.md flight-16 entry | LIVE-PROVEN 2026-07-24: flight 17 on the guard build = MISSION-OK + analyzer red=0 (the QuickloadResumeMatchGuard fix verified on a clean two-tree save; the one residual red was the spec's own dock token - docking MERGES trees, Parsek logs 'Tree merge created: type=Dock', only splits log 'Tree branch created'); flight 18 = FULL PASS, all seven verifiers green, fifth consecutive hard dock. Re-tiered nightly. 18-flight campaign, zero manual sessions |
| FORGE-bdock-station | operator | (Not a Parsek-surface test) FIXTURE-FORGE: launch_vessel the docking Kerbal X onto the pad + SaveGame -> stamps the bdock-station-pad fixture headlessly (replaces the operator fixture flight) | None - runnable now on a provisioned instance; harvest tool normalizes the output |
| FORGE-eva3-pad | operator | (Not a Parsek-surface test) FIXTURE-FORGE (EVA-3 sibling): launch_vessel the Kerbal X onto the pad with THREE named crew + SaveGame -> stamps the eva3-pad-3crew fixture headlessly. Uses the review-follow-up-2 crew (by NAME) + launch_site plumbing | DONE 2026-07-24: forge run + `harvest_bdock_station.py --target-name eva3-pad-3crew` produced the committed eva3-pad-3crew fixture, and EVA-3 flew it to a full PASS (the Kerbal X pad-EVA reachability caveat did NOT materialize) |
| FORGE-eva2-lko | operator | (Not a Parsek-surface test) FIXTURE-FORGE, the FIRST ORBITAL one (mission `forge_lko`): boots the SAME bdock-forge-base, launch_vessel the Kerbal X with TWO named crew (Valentina + Bob), then flies the LIVE-PROVEN B-DOCK Interceptor-leg shape - MechJeb ascent, circularization with node-executor autowarp EXPLICIT (flight-12 lesson), the two-step separation contract (drop the spent core AND ignite the orbital stage, thrust-verified, cap 2), then a PARK phase that cuts throttle, clears nodes, holds SAS+RCS and requires a HELD stable ~100 km circular orbit (pe >= 75 km, tumble <= 0.05 rad/s) before SaveGame. Crew is gated ON THE PAD (crew_count >= minCrew, fail-closed on the -1 unread sentinel) so an uncrewed stamp flakes in 300 s instead of after a 10-minute flight. autoRecordOnLaunch pinned false so the fixture carries zero Parsek state | Operator forge run + `harvest_bdock_station.py --target-name eva2-lko-crewed --expect-situation ORBITING` (the harvest's new optional situation gate, added for this orbital harvest). Until that lands, EVA-2-orbital-board stays pending-fixture |

Fixed (subscribe GameStateFacilityRecorder to OnKSCFacilityUpgrading, event-driven). Re-run confirms "Game state: FacilityUpgraded" present + re-tiers to daily |

### EVA (M-C2 + EVA-4), committed, pending in-game proof (4)

Verbs + pure deciders + hlib companions + specs are committed and green in
every headless suite; the "Blocker" is the operator live-prove list (P1-P6 in
`design-autotest-eva-missions.md`), which pins the recordings-count windows
(R-C), the exact structural-snapshot / orbital-auto-record log wording, and
the flag-capture proof. Parsek surfaces: EVA/Board tree branch points +
EvaCrewName, FlagEvent fidelity, crew conservation, foreground vs deferred EVA
recording paths.

| Test case | Tier | Parsek surface verified | Blocker |
|---|---|---|---|
| EVA-1-pad-flag | nightly | Foreground EVA branch (structural snapshot + EvaCrewName), FlagEvent capture into the foreground recorder, board merge back to the pod | First flight 2026-07-24: EvaExit (ladder release applied) + EvaBoard merge-back + StopRecording + CommitTree chain all green, analyzer save CLEAN. TWO gate/release defects FOUND + FIXED (both edge-triggered-FSM family): (1) PlantFlag gate read `Events["PlantFlag"].active`, an edge-triggered cache that latches stale-false when a kerbal lands and stands still on the pad; gate now reads live `CanPlantFlag()` + plantable-fsm-state. (2) Flight-2 (with the fixed gate + `blocked=` diag) NAMED the real blocker: `blocked=fsm=Ladder_Idle,no-ground-contact` for the full 180 s - EvaExit's `released=true` was a FALSE POSITIVE. The release fired `On_ladderLetGo` during the transitional `st_ladder_acquire` state (~0.2 s post-exit) where the event is not registered = a silent `RunEvent` no-op, so the kerbal hung on the hatch ladder forever. `ApplyLadderRelease` now fires ONLY from a receptive ladder state, VERIFIES the fsm left the ladder (synchronous RunEvent), bounded re-fire cap 3, and `released=true` means verified-left. (3) Flight-3 (both FSM fixes landed): the plant went in PHYSICALLY (`Kerbin/FlagPlant` milestone credited) but the recording-layer FlagEvent was never captured - `afterFlagPlanted` never fired. Decompiled `FlagSite`: the SiteRename popup that fires `afterFlagPlanted` (inside its button `afterDialog` callback) only spawns after the FULL plant-animation timer (`On_flagPlantComplete` KFSMTimedEvent) in `OnPlacementComplete`, but the seam's "edge case 10" fallback declared the dialog "answered-externally" as soon as the FlagSite vessel existed (created at `flagPlant_OnEnter`, ~110 ms in, before the animation), false-OK'd the plant, and `flushandquit` tore the scene down before the popup ever spawned. Fixed (seam side): the answered-externally inference is DELETED; the seam now waits for the real popup (`DecideSiteRenameDialogAction`) then invokes its dismiss button's own callback so `afterFlagPlanted` fires and Parsek captures the FlagEvent; honest `flag-timeout` if the popup never spawns. See todo-and-known-bugs.md. Re-flight pending to prove all three fixes + P6 flag-capture (`Flag planted: ... date stamped` + `Flag event captured`) end to end ; LIVE-PROVEN 2026-07-24 (flight 4 full PASS; 3 seam/fsm defects found+fixed: stale plant-gate cache, silent no-op ladder release, SiteRename dialog false-OK that skipped afterFlagPlanted) |
| EVA-2-orbital-board | pending-fixture | Deferred auto-record-on-EVA path (D1 auto-record-eva) + re-board; the settleSeconds dwell beats the auto-record race (F7) | STILL pending-fixture: `eva2-lko-crewed` does not exist yet. Its FORGE now does - FORGE-eva2-lko (mission `forge_lko`, operator tier) - so the remaining gate is the operator forge RUN + `harvest_bdock_station.py --target-name eva2-lko-crewed --expect-situation ORBITING`. The spec's fixture block now states the forged contract EVA-2 relies on (orbital stage only, 2 named crew with Valentina as crew[0], ~100 km circular pe >= 75 km, throttle cut, nodes cleared, SAS+RCS held, zero Parsek state). Then P3 count / P4 orbital auto-record wording, then re-tier to daily |
| EVA-3-multi-kerbal | nightly | Two sequential EVA branch points + two board merges in one tree; the F2 quiescence conjunct protects the second exit | Fixture `eva3-pad-3crew` COMMITTED (P2 done, forged 2026-07-24). First flight 2026-07-24: driverValidity PASS (all 4 EVA verbs OK, each exit->board cycle under 0.8 s wall), analyzer red=0, logValidate PASS, anomalySweep PASS; the only red was 2 missing logContract tokens (`detected boarding from EVA`, `Tree board merge completed`) for BOTH cycles. A PARSEK defect FOUND + FIXED: an EVA branch parks the kerbal's recording in BackgroundMap and only the post-switch first-modification watcher promotes it, so a `release=false` exit-then-board inside ~0.18 s left `recorder=null` at the board and BOTH the boarding detection and `HandleTreeBoardMerge` failed closed - the saved tree carried 2 EVA branch points and ZERO Board branch points, kerbal recordings terminal Destroyed instead of Boarded. `OnCrewBoardVessel` now rebinds a background-only EVA recording to the live recorder at the board (`DecideEvaBoardPromotion`, 11 xUnit cells); the seam was deliberately NOT changed (a wait-for-merge there would reclassify a dropped merge as driver INVALID instead of PARSEK-FAIL). Re-flight pending to pin the P3 count window and confirm 2 EVA branches + 2 boarding detections + 2 board merges. Batch autorun evaluated = NOT wired (batchComplete SKIPPED, see EVA-1 spec) ; LIVE-PROVEN 2026-07-24 (flight 2 full PASS after the board-merge data-loss fix; 2 promotions/2 merges/7 recordings) |
| EVA-4-atmo-chute | nightly | Mid-flight ATMOSPHERIC EVA branch (every other EVA case exits on the ground or in orbit), atmospheric TrackSections on the KERBAL's own falling-vessel recording, the EVA chute captured as a two-phase part event on the kerbal (D7 chute-two-phase, previously unclaimed), and the DOWN terminal applied to a KERBAL recording with the kerbal ALIVE | FLIGHT 1 (2026-07-24) ASSERT-FAILED AS DESIGNED, re-tuned, re-fly pending. The machine, the named-failure design and the diagnostics all worked: `eva-window-missed: altitude 702m fell below the window floor 800m (vspeed -295.2m/s, situation FLYING, craftChute armed)`, phasesReached PRELAUNCH/ASCENT/COAST/DESCENT, apoapsisWindow met (19,879 m), no budget burn (107 s wall). MEASURED profile: peak altitude 11,965 m at ut 60.6; unchuted descent settles at TERMINAL -301 m/s by ~2,700 m; chute armed at 2,382 m / -301 m/s and 5.1 s later at 855 m the rate had moved 4.7 m/s. ROOT CAUSE (recording + decompile, not inference): the pod's `.prec` carries ZERO Parachute* part events, and decompiled `ModuleParachute.cs:1255-1290` gates ACTIVE->SEMIDEPLOYED on `automateSafeDeploy >= deploymentSafeState` while the fixture persists `automateSafeDeploy = 0` (only while SAFE) - which DeploySafe never reads at ~300 m/s in dense air. Arming low was INERT, not late; a craft at terminal velocity never slows on its own. THREE FIXES: (1) ARM WHILE SLOW - the machine now arms on the COAST->DESCENT transition frame itself (falling through into the descent body so there is no one-poll delay; measured entry rates -7.4/-16.9/-26.1/-35.5 m/s, bound 30), i.e. at the apoapsis crossing where DeploySafe is trivially SAFE and Kerbin is already ~0.2 atm; (2) RAISE the stock full-deploy altitude from the fixture's 1000 m to 2500 m via kRPC `Parachute.DeployAltitude` (a PAW tweakable) so the full canopy exists well above the EVA band - the Mk16 animation is ~8 s (`deploymentSpeed = 0.12`); (3) GATE ON OBSERVED STATE - new opt-in `craft_chute_state` telemetry channel (kRPC `ParachuteState`, "" unread = fail-closed) so the window requires the chute to READ Deployed, never the commanded latch that was true for the whole failed flight. Window re-tuned [800,2400]/60 -> [700,2100]/25; descent budget 240 -> 480 s and runtime 1560 -> 1920 s (the craft now flies the descent under canopy, and its semi-deployed rate is not measured yet, so the budget out-waits a slow one rather than predicting it). A new `craftCanopyObserved` assertion row reports observed-vs-commanded in the result JSON. Same-evidence FINDING SPUN OFF: B1-pad-hop's chute never opens either (its 2026-07-20 recording has zero Parachute* events and ends at 65 m) - B1 passes because its DOWN terminal only checks the COMMANDED latch. Still first-flight-to-confirm: (P1) the recordings-count window 2-10, (P2) the `'kerbalEVA` part-name prefix, (P3) the craft's semi-deployed descent rate (the one number still unmeasured) ; LIVE-PROVEN 2026-07-24 (flight 2 FULL PASS, all seven verifiers: canopy observed Deployed, kerbal chuted descent steady -4.5 m/s, ParachuteCut at touchdown, down=true situation=LANDED alive=true; count pinned 3) |

## Mission-machine trust layer

The shared flyby machine (mlib) was hardened by 19+ live findings so that a
mission FAILURE is attributable to Parsek or the contract - never to
autopilot noise. Capabilities (all live-proven): native warp-to-UT with
zombie-safe cancel + asymmetric retargeting; certified no-1x coast
(`harness/warp_audit.py --fail-on-violation`, contiguous + cumulative);
flameout staging under both the DIY burner and the throttle-collapsing
MechJeb executor; bounded correction give-ups with warp-time-excluded
clocks; closed-loop arrival quality (patched-conic next_pe telemetry,
no-encounter creation, impact-certain early terminal); planner-bias margin
targets (finding 16d); 20+ telemetry channels + machine-state/gate-evidence
lines + live status CLI (`harness/status.py`). Full forensics per finding:
`todo-and-known-bugs.md`.

## Verification layers (all active)

- Headless: 330 mission-machine + 402 harness + 203 provisioner unittest
  cells; 18.5k+ xUnit on the C# side (analyzer, seam, log contracts, the
  new route-window delta formatter).
- Per-run: the 7-verifier chain + collect-logs on every non-PASS.
- In-game: 158 runtime tests / 42 categories (autorun-able), H5 invariants,
  log-contract tests.
- Findings baseline: 5 historical saves baselined; fresh harness saves run
  baseline-Forbid (structural fresh-save guard).
- Coverage ledger: 52 / 238 registry cells covered (the growth metric).

## Known gates and latent items (forensics in todo-and-known-bugs.md)

1. B6 20 km / B7 300 km course-correct targets - see the test-case table.
2. Runner-only kRPC behaviors are LIVE-VERIFIED ONLY (no headless guard can
   exercise MechJeb server state): intercept-only planner flags, executor
   abort-before-native-AP, deceleration_time override, Smart A.S.S. off.
   Their symptom signatures are the first triage suspects on recurrence.
3. STOCK_AWARD_PATTERNS are dead against real KSP logs: the ledger-oracle
   capture cross-check is a structural no-op until the pattern rewrite
   (needs the operator stock-award capture session).
4. Flake ledgers (generated, gitignored) reset 2026-07-22 post-campaigns;
   quarantine (sticky, >0.20) is reporting-only and now reflects post-merge
   reality only.
5. INV2 double-cover recorder seam: REAL Parsek defect (first big catch),
   being fixed in its own lane.
6. No-vessel LoadGame boot contract (ledger lane): the SPACECENTER route in
   `ParsekTestCommandAddon.LoadGameImpl` now writes `persistent.sfs`
   (`GamePersistence.SaveGame(game, "persistent", save, OVERWRITE)`) AFTER
   `UpdateScenarioModules` and BEFORE `Start()`, matching stock
   `MainMenu.OnLoadDialogPipelineFinished`. Load-bearing because the KSC scene
   bootstrap `SpaceCenterMain.Start()` re-reads `persistent.sfs` from disk and
   runs `SetProtoModules` on THAT game, not the in-memory `HighLogic.CurrentGame`;
   without the write the fresh-* fixtures booted to KSC with no ParsekScenario,
   so `OnLoad` never ran and the `GameStateRecorder` never subscribed (the 5
   ACTING L1 cases reded on the missing recorded-action log line though the
   ledger oracle passed). Fixed 2026-07-23.

## Operator items outstanding

1. Career fixture saves (3) - DONE + LIVE-PROVEN (no operator session): file-
   constructed (fresh-career / fresh-science / fresh-sandbox), 7/7 ledger
   scenarios green, re-tiered pending-fixture -> daily, hire/upgrade author
   constants confirmed, the seed-baseline no-pools gate resolved.
2. EVA fixture saves (2): `eva2-lko-crewed` + `eva3-pad-3crew` (M-C2 P2);
   re-tiers EVA-2/EVA-3 pending-fixture -> daily/nightly. Plus the EVA
   live-prove session (P1/P3/P5/P6) that promotes EVA-1 nightly -> daily.
   (Both fixtures are now forge-able headlessly via the B-DOCK forge.)
3. Stock-award real-line capture session (unblocks the pattern rewrite).
4. B9 rewind observation session (S1.5 + S4.1).

## Roadmap (agreed order; each item named by its Parsek utility)

1. M-C2 in-game proof - the verbs + hlib companions + EVA-1/2/3 specs are
   IMPLEMENTED (headless-green); the remaining work is the operator live-prove
   list (P1-P6): the two new fixtures (`eva2-lko-crewed`, `eva3-pad-3crew`),
   the first EVA-1/2/3 runs to pin count windows + log-token wording, and the
   ladder-drop / flag-capture confirmations. Unlocks the crew/EVA/flag
   recording surface no flight can reach.
2. B8 Mun/Minmus ORBIT missions - capture burn + commit-in-target-orbit
   terminal: recordings that END in a foreign SOI (new commit/BG-handoff
   surface vs the free-return shape).
3. Mun/Minmus LANDING missions - upper stage landed: landed-on-other-body
   recording, surface TrackSections off Kerbin, the landing FSM seam.
4. Ledger campaign resumption once career fixtures exist (L1 -> L2+): the
   initiative's END GOAL.
5. B-DOCK first flight - the docking/rendezvous lane (dock-undock recording
   structure) is now IMPLEMENTED (`autotest-bdock-impl`); remaining is the
   headless fixture-forge run (`FORGE-bdock-station` -> harvest -> commit
   `bdock-station-pad`), re-tier BDOCK-1 pending-fixture -> nightly, and the
   first flight (P1-P9 live-proves). It unlocks the D10 route-candidate +
   D5 cross-tree-dock/undock-split recording surface.
6. Candidates (unscheduled): Eve flyby (cheap B7 clone), stock-award pattern
   rewrite, nightly rotation shakedown, EVA registry growth (D5/D12 cells),
   an orbital-rendezvous-dock D10 registry value + a same-craft-twice
   identity D18 value (the two B-DOCK coverage gaps).
